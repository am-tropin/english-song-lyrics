14 Years	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/guns_n_roses/14_years-lyrics-28080.html	Album: Use Your Illusion II	"I try and feel the sunshine
You bring the rain
You try and hold me down
With your complaints
You cry and moan and complain
You whine an tear
Up to my neck in sorrow
The touch you bring
You just don't step inside to
14 years
So hard to keep my own head...
That's what I say
You know...I've been the beggar...
I've played the thief
I was the dog...they all tried to beat
But it's been
14 years of silence
It's been
14 years of pain
It's been
14 years that are gone forever
And I'll never have again
Your stupid girlfriends tell you
That I'm to blame
Well they're all used-up has-beens
Out of the game
This time I'll have the last word
You hear what I say
I tried to see it your way
It won't work today
You just don't step inside to
14 years
So hard to keep my own head...
That's what I say
You know...I've been the dealer...
Hangin' on your street
I was the dog...they all tried to beat
But it's been
14 years of silence
It's been
14 years of pain
It's been
14 years that are gone forever
And I'll never have again
Bullshit and contemplation
Gossip's their trade
If they knew half the real truth
What would they say
Well I'm past the point of concern
It's time to play
These last 4 years of madness
Sure put me straight
Don't get back 14 years
In just one day
So hard to keep my own head
Just go away
You know...just like a hooker she said
Nothin's for free
Oh I tried to see it your way
I tried to see it your way"
Ain't It Fun	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/guns_n_roses/aint_it_fun-lyrics-28098.html	Album: The Spaghetti Incident?	"Ain't it fun when you're always on the run
Ain't it fun when your friends despise what you become
Ain't it fun when you get so high
Well... that you, you just can't come
Ain't it fun when you know that you gonna die young
It's such fun
Good fun
Such fun
Such fun
Aah such fun
Such fun
Such fun aah
Yeah fun,
Just fun
Such...
Ain't it fun when you taking care of number one
Ain't it fun when you feel like you just gotta get a gun
Ain't it fun when you just can't seem to find your tounge
Cause you stuck it too deep into something that really stung
It's such fun, ah
Well, so good to me, they spit right in my face
I didn't even feel it
It was such a disgrace
I punched my fist right through the glass
I didn't even feel it
It happened so fast
Such fun
Such fun
Such fun
Ah such fun
Such fun
Such fun
Ah such fun
Ain't it fun when you tell her she's just a *****
Ain't it fun when you she splits you and leaves you on the bum
Well, ain't it fun when you've broken up every band that you've ever begun
Ain't it fun when you know that you're gonna die young
It's such fun
Such fun [x 13]"

Well I got somethin', I got somethin' for you

Bad Apples	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/guns_n_roses/bad_apples-lyrics-28076.html	Album: Use Your Illusion I	"Diamonds and fast cars
Money to burn
I got my head in the clouds
I got these thoughts to churn
Got my feet in the sand
I got a house on the hill
I got a headache like a mother
Twice the price of my thrills
An it's a cold day,
It's a continental drift
I said this traffic is hell
Can you give me a lift
An I'll try to paint a story
Got your pictures to tell
Yeah you got to make a living
With what you bring yourself to sell
I got some genuine
Imitation
Bad Apples
Free sample
For your peace o' mind
Only $9.95
I got my camera back from customs
Got my law fees up to date
Hell they musta seen me comin'
Ain't this life so fuckin' great
When the shit hit the fan
It was all I could stand
Yeah, well I'm a frequent flyer
My body's breathing while it can
But what I don't understand is that
My world ain't gettin' no brighter
If I could touch the sky
Well I would float on by
While everybody's talkin'
Hell I'm just another guy
If it were up to me
I'd say just leave me be
Why let one bad apple
Spoil the whole damn bunch
Gold and caviar
Now why'nt you pour my apathy
I'd have all my bases covered
If I could teach my hands to see
But now we're down in the deep end
Where they'd love to watch you drown
I said your laundry could use washing
We'll hang it up all over town
I said Hollywood's like a dryer
An we're down on Sunset Strip
An you'll be suckin' down the Clorox
'Til your life's all nice and crisp
When the shit hit the fan
It was all I could stand
Yeah, well I'm a frequent flyer
My body's breathing while it can
But what I don't understand is that
My world ain't gettin' no brighter
If I could touch the sky
Well I would float on by
While everybody's talkin'
Hell I'm just another guy
If it were up to me
I'd say just leave me be
Why let one bad apple
Spoil the whole damn bunch

And I can feel the slime, drippin' down her sleeve
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do
Ooh
Ooh
Well, it's late at night, and I'm all alone
And I can hear her boots as she's near her home
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do
[CHORUS:]
Scratch, scratch, she's clawing at the door
Whoa, no, I can't take it anymore
Crack, crack I'm feeling so sore
I never should asked for black leather
Black leather
Ooh, black leather
Ow black leather
And you can try to hide, but you won't get far
You can let her in, and you'll start it again
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do

Bohemian Rhapsody	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/guns_n_roses/bohemian_rhapsody-lyrics-28128.html	Album: Chinese Democracy	"Mama just killed a man, Put a gun against his head,
pulled my trigger, now he's dead.
Mama, life had just begun,
But now I've gone and thrown it all away.
Mama, ooh, Didn't mean to make you cry,
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters.
Too late, my time has come,
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time.
Goodbye, ev'rybody, I've got to go,
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth.
Mama, ooh, I don't want to die,
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.
I see a little silhouetto of a man,
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango.
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me.
(Galileo.) Galileo. (Galileo.) Galileo, Galileo figaro
Magnifico. I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me.
He's just a poor boy from a poor family,
Spare him his life from this monstrosity.
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go.
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go.
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go.
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go.
(Let me go.) Will not let you go.
(Let me go.) Will not let you go. (Let me go.) Ah.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
(Oh mama mia, mama mia.) Mama mia, let me go.
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me.
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye.
So you think you can love me and leave me to die.
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here.
Nothing really matters, Anyone can see,
Nothing really matters,
Nothing really matters to me.
Any way the wind blows."
Breakdown	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/guns_n_roses/breakdown-lyrics-28085.html	Album: Use Your Illusion II	"We all come in from the cold
We come down from the wire
An everybody warms themselves
to a different fire
When sometimes we get burned
You'd think sometime we'd learn
The one you love is the one
That should take you higher
You ain't got no one
You better go back out and find her..
Just like children hidin' in a closet
Can't tell what's goin' on outside
Sometimes we're so far off the beaten track
We'll get taken for a ride
By a parlor trick or some words of wit
A hidden hand up a sleeve
To think the one you love
could hurt you now
Is a little hard to believe
But everybody darlin' sometimes
Bites the hand that feeds
When I look around
Everybody always brings me down
Well is it them or me
Well I just can't see
But there ain't no peace to found
But if someone really cared
Well they'd take the time to spare
A moment to try and understand
Another one's despair
Remember in this game we call life
That no one said it's fair
BREAKDOWN
Let me hear it now
BREAKDOWN
let me hear it now
Yeah
BREAKDOWN
Let me hear it now
BREAKDOWN
let me hear it now
Get down with yo' bad self
Alright
I've come to know the cold
I think of it as home
When there ain't enough of me
To go around
I'd rather be left alone
But if I call you out of habit
I'm out of love and I gotta have it
Would you give it to me
If I fit you needs
Like when we both knew we had it
But now the damage's done
And we're back out on the run
Fun how ev'rything was Roses
When we held on to the Guns
Just because you're winnin'
Don't mean you're the lucky ones
BREAKDOWN
Let me hear it now
BREAKDOWN
Yeah
BREAKDOWN
BREAKDOWN
let me hear it now
""There goes the challenger being chased
By the blue blue meanies on wheels
The vicious traffic squad cars are
After our lone driver
The last American hero
The-the electric sintar
The demi-god,
The super driver of the golden west!
Two nasty Nazi cars are close behind
The beautiful lone driver
The police cars are getting closer-closer...
Closer to our soul hero in his soul mobile- Yeah baby!
They about to strike, They gonna get him, SMASH! RAPE!
The last beautiful free soul on this planet
But...it is writen if the Evil Spirit
Arms the Tiger with claws
Brahman provided wings for the Dove
Thus spake the Super Guru"" *
""Did you hear that"""
Bring It Back Home	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/guns_n_roses/bring_it_back_home-lyrics-28124.html	Album: Chinese Democracy	"Sweet little lady, don't you get crazy.
Bring it back home to me.
Woman little standing, dreaming to forget him.
Bring it back home to me.
When Why wonder
Brown-eyed stunner, come on,
Bring it home to me.
Kiss a little, fishing for your lover,
Won't you bring it down home to me.
See a sky lit on fire, seen the dog in here.
She lift her lips, with a passion, in the third degree.
See a dirty old lady, with a schoolgirl's grin
Break a back for the daddy all, when she does her thing.
You can see the love, like check an ounce for pain,
Darling won't you wanna;
Sorry to resent, you said; gimme back,
Keep your teeth
Never wanna hold you,
Never wanna kiss you,
I bet she's taking away from me.
Never will repeat it, or never reprimand it,
Will you bring it back home to me.
Take care before my baby,
When your baby gives it up for free.
She just puts around, being lazy,
But since she brings her lover to me.
Don't need nothing to save me, say for a piece of your luxury.
Like the doorfoot, you'll never gage it.
I'll tell you just how it's gonna be.
I call your lover in the morning,
When you have your cup of tea.
You never give me your warning,
So you better give her right up for me.
Guess who's coming over, on your thinks;
That's such a surprise.
If you're saying you never known her,
Honey, you better open your eyes.
Look out.
See a real long fire, she's the dog in here.
She lift her lips, with a passion, in the third degree.
See a dirty old lady, with a schoolgirl's grin.
Break a back for her daddy, when she does her thing.
Can't take care before my baby,
When your baby gives it up for free.
She just gets around being lazy,
Until she brings her loving to me.
I don't need nothing to save me,
Say for a piece of your luxury.
Lock the door, but you'll never gage me.
I tell you just how it's gonna be.
I call your lover in the morning,
When you have your cup of tea.
You never give me a warning,
So get yourself a letter from me.
Ohhhh, where're you going, tell me; who're you to see
I've been sleeping on your doorstep,
Baby, won't you bring it back home to me.
Get me something for my jealous mind,
You don't get something for free.
You just bring it down home to me.
Ha-Ha-Ha"

He came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch,
and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away,

Talkin' 'fore I knew it,

I'm gonna be like you, dad,
You know I'm gonna be like you

When you comin' home, son,
I don't know when
But we'll have a good time then, dad
You know we'll have a good time then.
My son turned ten just the other day,
he said
Thanks for the ball, dad,

Can you teach me to throw,
I said not today,
I got a lot to do,

Son I'm proud of you,
can we sit for a while?
He shook his head, and said, with a smile
What I'd really like, dad,
is to borrow the car keys
See ya later, can I have them please?

But we'll have a good time then, dad
You know we'll have a good time then.
I've long since retired,
my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day.
I said, I'd like to see you,
if you don't mind, he said
I'd love to, dad,
if I could find the time.
You see my new job's a hassle and the kids got the flu
But it's been sure nice talkin' to you, yeah
Sure nice talkin' to you.
And as I hung up the phone it occured to me,
He'd grown up just like me, yeah.
My boy was just like me.

You'll find out for yourself
No it don't really matter
You're gonna leave these thing to
Somebody else
If they missionaries
Real time visionaries
Sitting in a Chinese stew
To view my dis-infatu-ation
I know that I'm a classic case
Watch my disenchanted face
Blame it on the Falun Gong*
They've seen the end and you can't hold on now
Cause it would take a lot more hate than you
To stop the fascination
Even with an iron fist
Our baby got to rule the nation
But all I got is precious time
It don't really matter
You're gonna find out for yourself
No it don't really matter
So you can hear now from
Somebody else
Cause it would take a lot more time than you
I've got more masturbation
Even with your iron fist
Our baby got to rule the nation but all I got is
Precious time
Our baby got to rule the nation but all I got is
Precious time
It don't really matter
Gonna keep it to myself
No it don't really matter
So you can hear it now from
Somebody else
You think you got it all locked up inside
And if you beat them all up they'll die
Then you'll walk them home for the cells
Then now you'll dig for your road back to hell
And with your  makes you stop
As if your eyes were their eyes you can tell
In your lack of time"

Some men you just can't reach...
So, you get what we had here last week,
which is the way he wants it!
Well, he gets it!
N' I don't like it any more than you men.""
Look at your young men fighting
Look at your women crying
Look at your young men dying
The way they've always done before
Look at the hate we're breeding
Look at the fear we're feeding
Look at the lives we're leading
The way we've always done before
My hands are tied
The billions shift from side to side
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride
For the love of God and our human rights
And all these things are swept aside
By bloody hands time can't deny
And are washed away by your genocide
And history hides the lies of our civil wars
D'you wear a black armband
When they shot the man
Who said ""Peace could last forever""
And in my first memories
They shot Kennedy
I went numb when I learned to see
So I never fell for Vietnam
We got the wall of D.C. to remind us all
That you can't trust freedom
When it's not in your hands
When everybody's fightin'
For their promised land
And
I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor
Your power hungry sellin' soldiers
In a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh
I don't need your civil war
Look at the shoes your filling
Look at the blood we're spilling
Look at the world we're killing
The way we've always done before
Look in the doubt we've wallowed
Look at the leaders we've followed
Look at the lies we've swallowed
And I don't want to hear no more
My hands are tied
For all I've seen has changed my mind
But still the wars go on as the years go by
With no love of God or human rights
'Cause all these dreams are swept aside
By bloody hands of the hypnotized
Who carry the cross of homicide
And history bears the scars of our civil wars
""We practice selective annihilation of mayors
And government officials
For example to create a vacuum
Then we fill that vacuum
As popular war advances
Peace is closer"" **
I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor
Your power hungry sellin' soldiers
In a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh
And I don't need your civil war
I don't need your civil war
I don't need your civil war
Your power hungry sellin' soldiers
In a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh
I don't need your civil war
I don't need one more war
I don't need one more war
Whaz so civil 'bout war anyway"
Coma	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/guns_n_roses/coma-lyrics-28078.html	Album: Use Your Illusion I	"Hey you caught me in a coma
And I don't think I wanna
Ever come back to this...world again
Kinda like it in a coma
'Cause no one's ever gonna
Oh, make me come back to this...
world again
Now I feel as if I'm floating away
I can't feel all the pressure
And I like it this way
But my body's callin'
My body's callin'
Won't ya come back to this...
world again
Suspended deep in a sea of black
I've got the light at the end
I've got the bones on the mast
Well I've gone sailin',
I've gone sailin'
I could leave so easily
While friends are calling back to me
I said they're
They're leaving it all up to me
When all I needed was clarity
And someone to tell me
WHAT THE ***** IS GOING ON
GODDAMN IT!
Slippin' farther an farther away
It's a miracle how long we can stay
In a world our minds created
In a world that's full of shit
HELP ME
HELP ME
HELP ME
HELP ME
BASTARD
Please understand me
I'm climbin' through the wreackage
Of all my twisted dreams
But this cheap investigation just
Can't stifle all my screams
And I'm waitin' at the crossroads
Waiting for you
Waiting for you
WHERE ARE YOU
No one's gonna bother me anymore
No one's gonna mess with my head no more
I can't understand what all the fightin's for
But it's so nice here down off the shore
I wish you could see this
'Cause there's nothing to see
It's peaceful here and it's fine with me
Not like the world where I used to live
I NEVER REALLY WANTED TO LIVE
ZAP HIM AGAIN
ZAP THE SON OF A ***** AGAIN
Ya live your life like it's a coma
So won't you tell me why we'd wanna
With all the reasons you give it's
It's kinda hard to believe
But who am I to tell you that I've
Seen any reason why you should stay
Matbe we'd be better off
Without you anyway
You got a one way ticket
On your last chance ride
Gotta one way ticket
To your suicide
Gotta one way ticket
An there's no way out alive
An all this crass communication
That has left you in the cold
Isn't much for consolation
When you feel so weak and old
But is home is where the heart is
Then there's stories to be told
No you don't need a doctor
No one else can heal your soul
Got your mind in submission
Got your life on the line
But nobody pulled the trigger
They just stepped aside
They be down by the water
While you watch 'em waving goodbye
They be callin' in the morning
They be hangin' on the phone
They be waiting for an answer
When you know nobody's home
And when the bell's stopped ringing
It was nobody's fault but your own
There were always ample warnings
There were always subtle signs
And you would have seen it comin'
But we gave you too much time
And when you said
That no one's listening
Why'd your best friend drop a dime
Sometimes we get so tired of waiting
For a way to spend our time
An ""It's so easy"" to be social
""It's so easy"" to be cool
Yeah it's easy to be hungry
When you ain't got shit to lose
And I wish that I could help you
With what you hope to find
But I'm still out here waiting
Watching reruns of my life
When you reach the point of breaking
Know it's gonna take some time
To heal the broken memories
That another man would need
Just to survive"

Crash Diet	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/guns_n_roses/crash_diet-lyrics-28112.html	Album: Chinese Democracy	"Crash diet of reds'n'ludes
A shot of vitamin C and a bottle of booze
Too stupid to live with nothin' to lose
In your one track mind now
Where's that leave you
Drink'n'drive white lightning faster baby
Takin' your last ride
Now better be so careful or you'll be dead before you time
Sorry you took mother's car now
Tears in my eyes, baby please don't go
You bet (!) one too many, now one for the road
fresh outta detox, fresh from jail
Took your rehabilitation and you drove me to hell
Drink'n'drive white lightning faster
Takin' your last ride
Better be so careful or you'll be dead before your time
Sorry you took mohter's car now
Too soon, you thought ... !
Too late for the pressure and strain
Too bad for those who don't believe it
Ruby street still calls your name
[guitar solo]
Itchy trigger finger and the race to be alive
Smokin' a cig while you drink'n'drive
With no control in your life ahead
You're never gonna see if you wind up dead
Drink'n'drive white lightning faster
Takin' your last ride
Better be so careful or you'll be dead before your time
Drink'n'drive white lightning baby
It's always on your mind
Push or pull your limits baby, do it one more time
Break it down
Break it down
Somethin's changin', somethin's breakin'
You gotta be a brother, 'coz ! your family
!.... Oh make it
Sweet mystery, Ooohhhh
If you don't care about yourself
Would you please leave me alive
Oooohhhh...
You gonna
You gonna drink'n'drive
Oooohhhhh, Yeeaaah!"
Dead Horse	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/guns_n_roses/dead_horse-lyrics-28077.html	Album: Use Your Illusion I	"Sick of this life
Not that you'd care
I'm not the only one with
whom these feelings I share
Nobody understands,
quite why we're here
We're searchin' for answers
That never appear
But maybe if I looked real hard I'd
I'd see your tryin' too
To understand this life,
That we're all goin' through
(Then when she said she was gonna like wreck my car...
I didn't know what to do)
Sometimes I feel like I'm beatin' a dead horse
An I don't know why you'd be bringin' me down
I'd like to think that our love's worth a tad more
It may sound funny but you'd think by now
I'd be smilin'
I guess some things never change
Never change
I met an old cowboy
I saw the look in his eyes
Somethin' tells me he's been here before
'Cause experience makes you wise
I was only a small child
When the thought first came to me
That I'm a son of a gun and the gun of a son
That brought back the devil in me
Sometimes I feel like I'm beatin' a dead horse
An I don't know why you'd be bringin' me down
I'd like to think that our love's worth a tad more
It may sound funny but you'd think by now
I'd be smilin'
I guess some things never change
Never change
I ain't quite what you'd call an old soul
Still wet behind the ears
I been around this track a couple o' times
But now the dust is startin' to clear
Oh yeah!!!
Sometimes I feel like I'm beatin' a dead horse
An I don't know why you'd be bringin' me down
I'd like to think that our love's worth a tad more

Ooh yeah, I'd be smilin'
No way I'd be smilin'

Don't Damn Me	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/guns_n_roses/dont_damn_me-lyrics-466827.html	Album: Use Your Illusion I	"Don't damn me
When I speak a piece of my mind
'Cause silence isn't golden
When I'm holding it inside
'Cause I've been where I have been
An I've seen what I have seen
I put the pen to the paper
'Cause it's all a part of me
Be it a song or casual conversation
To hold my tongue speaks
Of quiet reservations
Your words once heard
They can place you in a faction
My words may disturb
But at least there's a reaction
Sometimes I wanna kill
Sometimes I wanna die
Sometimes I wanna destroy
Sometimes I wanna cry
Sometimes I could get even
Sometimes I could give up
Sometimes I could give
Sometimes I never give a *****
It's only for a while
I hope you understand
I never wanted this to happen
Didn't want to be a man
So I hid inside my world
I took what I could find
I cried when I was lonely
I fell down when I was blind
But don't damn me
When I speak a piece of my mind
'Cause silence isn't golden
When I'm holding it inside
'Cause I've been where I have been
An I've seen what I have seen
I put the pen to the paper
'Cause it's all a part of me
How can I ever satisfy you
An how can I ever make you see
That deep inside we're all somebody
An it don't matter who you wanna be
But now I gotta smile
I hope you comprehend
For this man can say it happened
'Cause this child has been
condemned
So I stepped into your world
I kicked you in the mind
An I'm the only witness
To the nature of my crime
But look at what we've done
To the innocent and young
Whoa listen to who's talking
'Cause we're not the only ones
The trash collected by the eyes
And dumped into the brain
Said it tears into our
conscious thoughts
You tell me who's to blame
I know you don't wanna hear me cryin'
An I know you don't wanna hear me deny
That your satisfaction lies in your ILLUSIONS
But your delusions are yours and not mine
We take for granted we know the whole story
We judge a book by its cover
And read what we want
Between selected lines
Don't hail me
An don't idolize the ink
Or I've failed in my intentions
Can you find the missing link
Your only validation is living your own life
Vicarious existence is a ***** waste of time
So I send this song to the offended
I said what I meant and I've never pretended
As so many others do intending just to please
If I damned your point of view
Could you turn the other cheek
But don't damn me
When I speak a piece of my mind
'Cause silence isn't golden
When I'm holding it inside
'Cause I've been where I have been
An I've seen what I have seen
I put the pen to the paper
'Cause it's all a part of me
Don't damn me
I said don't damn me
I said don't hail me
Don't damn me"

Down On The Farm	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/guns_n_roses/down_on_the_farm-lyrics-28095.html	Album: The Spaghetti Incident?	"All I need is some inspiration
Before I do somebody some harm
I feel just like a vegetable
Down here on the farm
Nobody comes to see me
Nobody here to turn me on
I ain't even got a lover
Down here on the farm
They told me to get healthy
They told me to get some sun
But boredom eats me like cancer
Down here on the farm
Drinkin' lemonade shanty
Ain't nobody here to do me harm
But I'm like a fish out of water
Down here on the farm
I wrote a thousand letters
Till my fingers all gone numb
But I never see no postman
Down here on the farm
I call my baby on the telephone
I say come down and have some fun
But she knows what the score is
Down here on the farm
I can't fall in love with a wheatfield
I can't fall in love with a barn
When everything smells like horse shit
Down here on the farm
Blue skies and swimming pools
Add so much charm
But I'd rather be back in Soho
Than down here on the farm
On the ***** farm!
Are you born in a ***** barn or what?
Baaaaaah!
HOLD STILL"

For all the wrong I've done
I never meant to hurt nobody, no no
Lord I never want to do no wrong
And I have lied, and I have begged and I have cheated
And I know my ship, it won't be coming in
And as I lay me down to take my rest
I can see that it's just dust in the wind
Take hold my hand, and hold it tighter, ever tighter
You must believe that I love you still
But my strength, it grows weaker, and weaker
And my body has lost its will
'Cause I have lied, and I have begged and I have cheated
And I know my ship, it won't be coming in
And as I lay me down to take my rest
I can see that it's just dust in the wind
Oh Lord, I have lost once again
And there's no one to help me find my way home
Lord and I, Lord I never want to hurt nobody
And I, Lord I never want to do no wrong

And I know my ship, it won't be coming in

He lost his mind today
He left it out back on the highway
On  65
She loved him yesterday
Yesterday's over
I said okay
That's all right
Time moves on
That's the way
We live an hope to see the next day
That's all right
Sometimes these things they are so easy
Sometimes these things they are so cold
Sometimes these things just seem to rip you right in two
Oh no man don't let 'em get ta you
She loved him yesterday
He laid her sister
She said O.K.
An that's all right
Buried her things today
Way back out deep
Behind the driveway
And that's all right
Sometimes these women are so easy
Sometimes these women are so cold
Sometimes these women seem to rip you right in two
Only if you let 'em get to you
Ya get out on your own
And you/take all that you own
And you/forget about your home
And then you're/just fuckin' gone
There's no logic here today
Do as you got to, go your own way
I said that's right
Time's short your life's your own
And in the end
We are just

Estranged	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/guns_n_roses/estranged-lyrics-28089.html	Album: Use Your Illusion II	"(Rose)
When you're talkin to yourself
And nobody's home
You can fool yourself
You came in this world alone
(Alone)
So nobody ever told you baby
How it was gonna be
So what'll happen to you baby
Guess we'll have to wait and see
One, two
Old at heart but I'm only 28
And I'm much too young
To let love break my heart
Young at heart but it's getting much too late
To find ourselves so far apart
I don't know how you're s'posed
To find me lately
An what more could you ask from me
How could you say that I never needed you
When you took everything
Said you took everything from me
Young at heart an it gets so hard to wait
When no one I know can seem to help me now
Old at heart but I musn't hesitate
If I'm to find my own way out
Still talkin' to myself and nobody's home
(Alone)
So nobody ever told us baby
How it was gonna be
So what'll happen to us baby
Guess we'll have to wait and see
When I find out all the reasons
Maybe I'll find another way
Find another day
With all the changing seasons of my life
Maybe I'll get it right next time
An now that you've been broken down
Got your head out of the clouds
You're back down on the ground
And you don't talk so loud
An you don't walk so proud
Any more, and what for
Well I jumped into the river too many times
to make it home
I'm out here on my own, an drifting all alone
If it doesn't show give it time
To read between the lines
'Cause I see the storm getting closer
And the waves they get so high
Seems everything We've ever known's here
Why must it drift away and die
I'll never find anyone to replace you
Guess I'll have to make it thru, this time
Oh this time
Without you
I knew the storm was getting closer
And all my friends said I was high
But everything we've ever known's here
I never wanted it to die"
Every Rose Has Its Thorn	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/guns_n_roses/every_rose_has_its_thorn-lyrics-212946.html	-	"We both lost sight of steel in the dead of the night
Allthought we both lie close together
We feel miles apart inside
Was it something I said or something I did
Did my words not come out right
Though I tried not to hurt
Though I tried
But I guess that's why they say
Every rose has it's thorn
Just like every night has it's dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song
Every rose has it's thorn
I listen to her favorite song playin on the radio
Yeah the DJ say it's a game
Easy come and easy go
But I wonder does he know
Has it ever felt like this
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I coulda let you know somehow
I guess every rose has it's thorn
Just like every night has it's dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song
Every rose has it's thorn
Though it's been awhile now
I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you
The wound heals
But the scar, the scar still remains
I know I coulda saved that night
If I'da known what to say
Instead of making love
We both made out seperate ways
Now I hear you found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
You hear that love inside
See you cuts me with a knife"
Garden Of Eden	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/guns_n_roses/garden_of_eden-lyrics-28074.html	Album: Use Your Illusion I	"It's a critical solution

Like the lies they sell to you
You got a glass jawed toothache
Of a mental disease
An they be runnin' round back
See 'em line up on their knees
'Cause the kiss ass sycophants
Throwin' penance at your feet
When they got nowhere to go
Watch 'em come in off the streets
While they're bangin' out front
Inside their slammin' to the cruch
Go on an throw me to the lions
And the whole damn screamin' bunch

'R' everywhere you turn
Tell me how a generation's
Ever s'posed to learn
This fire is burnin'
and it's out of control
It's not a problem you can stop
It's rock n' roll
I read it on a wall
It went straight to my head
It said 'Dance to the tension
of a world on edge'
We got racial violence
And who'll cast the first stone
And ***** is used anyway it can be
Sometimes when I look out
It's hard to see the day
It's a feelin' you can have it
It's not mine to take away
Lost in the garden of Eden
Said we're lost in the garden of Eden
And there's no one's gonna believe this
But we're lost in the garden of Eden
This fire is burnin'

There's no way I'm gonna fit in
Don't ya tell me what my eyes see
Don't ya tell me who to believe in
I ain't superstitious
But I know when somethin's wrong
I've been draggin' my heels
With a ***** called hope
Let the undercurrent drag me along
Lost in the garden of Eden
Said we're lost in the garden of Eden
And there's no one's gonna believe this
But we're lost in the garden of Eden
Most organized religions make
A mockery of humanity
Our governments are dangerous
And out of control
The garden of Eden is just another graveyard
Said if they had someone to buy it
Said I'm sure they'd sell my soul
This fire is burnin'
and it's out of control
It's not a problem you can stop
It's rock n' roll
Lost in the garden of Eden
(An we ain't talkin' about no poison apple or some missin' rib ya hear)
Said we're lost in the garden of Eden
And there's no one's gonna believe this
Said we're lost in the garden of Eden
This fire is burnin'

You're a heart-breakin' soul shaker
I've been told about you
I've seen y'on the midnight show girl
A-what they been sayin' must be true
Red hot mama
There'll be trouble
I say time's gonna pay your dues
[CHORUS:]
Now you're messin' with a A SON OF A *****
Now you're messin' with a son of a *****
Now you're messin' with a A SON OF A *****
Now you're messin' with a son of a *****
Talkin' jive and poison ivy
You ain't gonna cling to me
Man take a bold thinker
I ain't so blind I can't see
Red hot mama
There'll be trouble
I say time's gonna pay your dues

Heartbreak Hotel	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/guns_n_roses/heartbreak_hotel-lyrics-28114.html	Album: Chinese Democracy	"Well, since my baby left me,
I found a new place to dwell.
It's down at the end of lonely street
at Heartbreak Hotel.
You make me so lonely baby,
I get so lonely,
I get so lonely I could die.
And although it's always crowded,
you still can find some room.
Where broken hearted lovers
do cry away their gloom.
You make me so lonely baby,
I get so lonely,
I get so lonely I could die.
Well, the Bell hop's tears keep flowin',
and the desk clerk's dressed in black.
Well they been so long on lonely street
They ain't ever gonna look back.
You make me so lonely baby,
I get so lonely,
I get so lonely I could die.
Hey now, if your baby leaves you,
and you got a tale to tell.
Just take a walk down lonely street
to Heartbreak Hotel."
Human Being	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/guns_n_roses/human_being-lyrics-28096.html	Album: The Spaghetti Incident?	"One, two, three four
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Well if you don't like it, go ahead,
Find yourself a saint, go ahead now
Try to find a boy who's gonna be what I ain't
And what you need is a plastic doll with a fresh coat of paint
Who's gonna sit through all the madness always, act so quaint,
I said - a. Oh yeah, well - a.
It's your new friend, you're really
Making a scene, and I've seen you
Bouncing around, from machine to machine
But you know that
They're never really
Never really what they seem, and you can count on
Generate some warmth, then you'll
See just what I mean, oh baby, baby, baby yeah.
Then if I'm acting like a king, don't you know it's 'cause
I'm a human being, and if I
Want too many things, don't you know it's 'cause
I'm a human being
And if I've got to dream, don't you know it's 'cause
I'm a human being, and well if
It's a bit obscene, don't you know it's 'cause
I'm a human being
I don't gotta walk around with my head on down
Just like a human, oh no a human being
I can hold my head so high
Just like a human, a real proud human being.
Won't you give me a little sip why won't you give me a
Drag of that cigarette, why don't you
Try to give me something, that I'll
Never ever forget, but now
Could you blow it all, on a
Million dollar bet, because you're
Liable to lose it on a
Best lovin' you've had yet, oh baby baby, oh yeah.
Then if I'm acting like a king, don't you know it's 'cause
I'm a human being, and if I
Want too many things, don't you know it's 'cause
I'm a human being
And if I've got to dream, don't you know it's 'cause
I'm a human being, and well if
It's a bit obscene, don't you know it's 'cause
I'm a human being
I don't gotta walk around with my head on down
Just like a human, oh no a human being
I can hold my head so high
Just like a human, a real proud human being.
It's like I'm talkin' 'bout the human race
You're tryin' to cover up a big disgrace
Baby, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, come on, come on
Well I may think that this whole scene is just a
Too appalling for me
Well, I may be the type who's just mad about
Funny little thing that I see, but I can
Colour that with history, and make it
Just what I want it to be, well I'm
Blowin' my change on the fan magazines, with all the
Hollywood refugees, oh baby baby oh yeah.
Then if I'm acting like a king, don't you know it's 'cause
I'm a human being, and if I
Want too many things, don't you know it's 'cause
I'm a human being
And if I've got to dream, don't you know it's 'cause

Imagine	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/guns_n_roses/imagine-lyrics-505709.html	Album: Singles	"Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today...
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace...
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world...
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one"

And you're gonna have to catch me if you wanna wash it out,
Cuz I'll be standin' on the corner, callin' you names,
With my juvenile skills and juvenile games
Cuz I'm a fast motherfucker,
Let me tell you 'bout it sucker,
If you fuck with me, I'll fuck your mother,
Your sister, too, and your best girlfriend,
Then I'll line 'em up, and put 'em end to end,
And then I'll put (stick) it in, I'll pull it out,
I'll grab your face and then I'll cum in your mouth.

That it's alright, yes it's alright
Where to go, Where to see
It's always been that way and it can never be

Give it all and ask for no return
And very soon you'll see and you'll begin to learn

It's so easy, easy
When everybody's tryin' to please me
Cars are crashin' every night
I drink n'drive everything's in sight

But I miss the firefight
I hit the bull's eye every night
It's so easy, easy
When everybody's tryin' to please me baby
Yeah it's so easy, easy
When everybody's tryin' to please me
So easy
But nothin' seems to please me
It all fits so right
When I fade into the night
See me hit you
You fall down
I see you standin' there
You think you're so cool
Why don't you just
***** off
Ya get nothin' for nothin'
If that's what ya do
Turn around ***** I got a use for you
Besides you ain't got nothin' better to do
And I'm bored
It's so easy, easy
When everybody's tryin' to please me baby
It's so easy, easy
When everybody's tryin' to please me
So easy
But nothin' seems to please me
It all fits so right
When I fade into the night
So come with me
Don't ask me where 'cause I don't know
I'll try ta please you

Just Another Sunday	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/guns_n_roses/just_another_sunday-lyrics-28125.html	Album: Chinese Democracy	"I know you've been dreaming 'bout the times in our lives
But I've been screaming in my bed late at night
A space a little, little and your stack of pain
Makes it grip that skull, to me child that you'll stay
You've been in my life so long, can I get through to you
I touch you eyes and it shades my life blue
There's something I need to say before it's to late
But I won't hold you back, while I'm begging you to stay
Just another Sunday
Just another Sunday
Oh yaaa, just another Sunday
Just another Sunday, oh yaaa
There's too many games in a day for a simple man to face
That desperate moment in your life where you can't be afraid
Don't think your second chance will break around the bend
'Cos hearts don't always share love, or the person on the other
end
You've been in my life so long, can I get through to you
I touch you eyes and it shades my life blue
There's something I need to say before it's to late
But I won't hold you back, while I'm begging you to stay ya
Just another Sunday yaa
Just another Sunday oh baby
It's only one more Sunday
Just another Sunday, oh yaaa
Those are tickets for the same plane, bring it back to me
'Cos felling the same pain makes half the luxery
Take a walk away won't end the carousel
But if walking away can bring you back, then I wish you well
You've been in my life so long, can I get through to you
I touch you eyes and it shades my life blue
There's something I need to say before it's to late
But I won't hold you back, while I'm begging you to stay
Just another Sunday yaa
Just another Sunday oh baby
It's only one more Sunday
Just another Sunday
It's just another Sunday
It's just another
Just another Sunday
Just another oh yaa
Just another Sunday"

and your heart was an open book
You used to say live and let live

But if this ever changin
in which we live in
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die
Live and let die
What does it matter to ya
When ya got a job to do
Ya got to do it well
You got to give the other fella hell
You used to say live and let live
you know you did
you know you did
you know you did
But if this ever changin
in which we live in
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die
Live and let die"
Locomotive	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/guns_n_roses/locomotive-lyrics-28087.html	Album: Use Your Illusion II	"Gonna find a way to cure this loneliness
Yeah I'll find a way to cure the pain
If I said that you're my friend
And our love would never end
How long before I had your trust again
I opened up the doors when it was cold outside
Hopin' that you'd find your own way in
But how can I protect you
Or try not to neglect you
When you won't take the love I have to give
I bought me an illusion
An I put it on the wall
I let it fill my head with dreams
And I had to have them all
But oh the taste is never so sweet
As what you'd believe it is-
Well I guess it never is
It's these prejudiced illusions
That pump the blood
To the heart of the biz
You know I never thought
That it could take so long
You know I never knew how to be strong
Yeah, I let you shape me
But I feel as though you raped me
'Cause you climbed inside my world
And in my songs
So now I've closed the door
To keep the cold outside
Seems somehow I've found the will to live
But how can I forget you
Or try not to reject you
When we both know it takes time to forgive
Sweetness is a virtue
And you lost your virtue long ago
You know I'd like to hurt you
But my conscience always tells me no
You could sell your body on the street
To anyone whom you might meet
Who'd love to try and get inside
And bust your innocence open wide
'Cause my baby's got a locomotive
My baby's gone off the track
My baby's got a locomotive
Got ta peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like I'm insane
Take a closer look I'm not to blame
No
Gonna have some fun with my frustration
Gonna watch the big screen in my head
I'd rather take a detour
'Cause this road ain't gettin' clearer
Your train of thought has cut me off again
Better tame that boy 'cause he's a wild one
Better tame that boy for he's a man
Sweetheart don't make me laugh
You's gettin' too big for your pants
And I's think maybe you should
Cut out while you can
You can use you illusion-
Let it take you where it may
We live and learn
And then sometimes it's best to walk away
Me I'm just here hangin' on
It's my only place to stay at least
For now anyway
I've worked too hard for my illusions
Just to throw them all away
I'm taking time for quiet consolation
In passing by this love that's passed away
I know it's never easy-
So why should you believe me
When I've always got so many things to say
Calling off the dogs a simple choice is made
'Cause playful hearts
Can sometimes be enraged
You know I tried to wake you-
I mean how long could it take you
To open up your eyes and turn the page
Kindness is a treasure-
And it's one towards me you've seldom shown
So I'll say it for good measure
To all the ones like you I've known
Ya know I'd like to shave your head
And all my friends could
paint it red
'Cause love to me's a two way street
An all I really want is peace
But my baby's got a locomotive
My baby's gone off the track
My baby's got a locomotive
Got ta peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like I'm insane
Take a closer look I'm not to blame
No
Affection is a blessing
Can you find it in your sordid heart
I tried to keep this thing
ta-gether
But the tremor tore my pad apart
Yeah I know it's hard to face
When all we've worked for's gone to waste
But you're such a stupid woman
And I'm such a stupid man
But love like time's got its own plans
'Cause my baby's got a locomotive
My baby's gone off the track
My baby's got a locomotive
Got ta peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like I'm insane
Take a closer look I'm not to blame
Yeah
If love is blind I guess
I'll buy myself a cane
LOVE'S SO STRANGE"

What a mad delusion
Living in that confusion
Frustration and doubt
Can you ever live without the game
The sad, sad game
Mad game
Just to say loves' not enough
If it can't be true
Oh, you can tell those lies baby but you're only fooling you

No I won't be told anymore
That I've been brought back in this storm
And left so far out from the shore
That I can't find my way back, my way anymore
No, I..
No, I...
Forgive that they teared down my soul
Bless them that they might grow old
A dream that's forgotten may know
That it's never too late
So many times that I've seen life before me
I searched and found the way to choose to the end
I found a way, to know, why it had to be
Mired in denial and saw all the rain
If we ever find it true
Love will have its way to choose
Three more to tame
We can be ever
I won't be told anymore
That I've been brought down in this storm
And left so far out from the shore
And I can't find my way back, my way anymore
No I won't be told anymore
That I've been brought back in this storm

Into the city where it all began
You gotta move
You gotta move

Sometimes it gets too shitty!
Come on and hit me!

You do what you gotta do for the money

You gotta move
You gotta move
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma
Time you gotta move
Oh right to the city
With the real nitty gritty
Aw, child, ain't it a pity?
Sometimes it gets too shitty!
Come on and hit me!"

Get outta bed around nine
And I don't worry about nothin' no
Cause worryin's a waste of my time
The show usually starts around seven
We go on stage around nine
Get on the bus about eleven
Sippin' a drink and feelin' fine
We been dancin' with
Mr. Brownstone
He's been knockin'
He won't leave me alone
I used ta do a little
but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryin'
ta get a little better
Said a little better than before
I used ta do a little

So the little got more and more
I just keep tryin'

Said a little better than before
We been dancin' with

He won't leave me alone
No, No, No, He won't leave me alone
Now I get up around whenever
I used ta get up on time
But that old man
he's a real muthafucker
Gonna kick him on down the line
I used ta do a little
but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryin'
ta get a little better
Said a little better than before
I used ta do a little

He won't leave me alone
No, No, No, he won't leave me alone
He won't leave me alone
Stuck it in the middle, and I
Shout it in the middle, and I
It drove me out of my mind
Shoulda known better, said
I wish I never met her, said I
I leave it all behind"

Now that mommy's not around
She used to love her heroin
But now she's underground
So you stay out late at night
And you do your dope for free
Drivin' your friends crazy
With your life's insanity
Well, well, well you just can't tell
Well, well, well my Michelle
Look out!
Sowin' all your wild oats
In another's luxuries
Yesterday was Tuesday
Maybe Thursday you can sleep
But school starts much too early
And this hotel wasn't free
So party till your connection calls
Honey I'll return the key
Well, well, well you just can't tell
Well, well, well my Michelle
Well, well, well you never can tell
Well, well, well my Michelle
Everyone needs love
You know that it's true
Someday you'll find someone
That'll fall in love with you
But oh the time it takes
When you're all alone
Someday you'll find someone
That you can call your own
But till then ya better...
Now you're clean
And so discreet
I won't say a word
But most of all this song is true
Case you haven't heard
So come on and stop your cryin'
'Cause we both know money burns
Honey don't stop tryin;
An you'll get what you deserve
Well, well, well you just can't tell
Well, well, well my Michelle
Well, well, well you never can tell
Well, well, well my Michelle

It's a sociopsychotic state of bliss
You've been delayed in the real world
How many times have you hit and missed?
You cat-scan shows disfiguration
I wanna laugh myself to death
With a misfired synapse
with a bent configuration
I'll hold the line while you gasp for breath
You wanna talk to me
So talk to me
You wanna talk to me [7 times]
You can't talk to me
You don't understand your *****
You ain't been mindfucked yet

Hey!

It's kinda strange like a stormy sea
I don't know why, don't know why
These kind of things gotta be

I got a new rose, I got it good
Yes, I knew that I always would
I can't stop to mess around
I got a brand new rose in town
See the sun, see the sunny skies
Don't get too close it'll burn your eyes
Don't you run away that way
Come back another day
[CHORUS]
I never thought this could happen to me
I'm a strange washing machine
I never served somebody this sane
I haven't met her, maybe too late
Hey!
I got a feeling inside of me
It's kinda strange like a stormy sea
I don't know why, I don't know why
I guess these things've gotta be

Nice Boys	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/guns_n_roses/nice_boys-lyrics-28040.html	Album: Live Like A Suicide	"She hit town like a rose in bloom
Smellin' sweet, said sweet perfume
The color faded and the petals died
Down in the city, no one cried
In the streets, the garbage lies
Protected by a million flies
The roaches so big
You know that they got bones
They moved in and made a tenement home
I said nice boys
Don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
I'm not a nice boy!
Sweet sixteen she was fresh and clean
Wanted so bad to be part of the scene
She met the man and she did the smack
Paid the price layin' flat on her back
Wanted so bad just to please the boys
They ended up just being a toy
Played so hard burned her life away
Lies were told no promises made
You know nice boys
Don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
I'm not a nice boy and I never was!
Young and fresh when she hit town
Hot for kicks just to get around
But now she lays in a filthy room
She kills the pain with
A flick and a spoon
And in the streets the garbage lies
Protected by a million flies
You know the roaches so big
You know that they got bones
Moved in and made a tenement home
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
No,no,no,no,no,no,no,no baby
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
I bet you mama said
'Nice boys don't play rock and roll'
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys!"

Well I'm a west coast struttin'
One bad mother
Got a rattlesnake suitcase
Under my arm
Said I'm a mean machine
Been drinkin' gasoline
An honey you can make my motor hum
I got one chance left
In a nine live cat
I got a dog eat dog sly smile
I got a Molotov cocktail with a match to go
I smoke my cigarette with stile
An I can tell you honey
You can make my money tonight
Wake up late honey put on your clothes
Take your credit card to the liquor store
That's one for you and two for me by tonight
I'll be
Loaded like a freight train
Flyin' like an aeroplane
Feelin' like a space brain
One more tonight
I'm on the nightrain
Bottoms up
I'm on the nightrain
Fill my cup
I'm on the nightrain
Ready to crash and burn
I never learn
I'm on the nightrain
I love that stuff
I'm on the nightrain

November Rain	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/guns_n_roses/november_rain-lyrics-28072.html	Album: Use Your Illusion I	"When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But darlin' when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain
We've been through this such a long long time
Just tryin' to kill the pain
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today
Walking away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head
Just knowin' that you were mine
All mine
So if you want to love me
then darlin' don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain
Do you need some time...on your own
Do you need some time...all alone
Everybody needs some time...on their own
Don't you know you need some time...all alone
I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you
Sometimes I need some time...on my own
Sometimes I need some time...all alone
Everybody needs some time...on their own
Don't you know you need some time...all alone
And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame
So never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Even cold November rain
Don't ya think that you need somebody
Don't ya think that you need someone
Don't ya think that you need somebody
Don't ya think that you need someone
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody
Don't ya think that you need someone
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody
Don't ya think that you need someone
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody
Don't ya think that you need someone
Everybody needs somebody"

Like you've been right
You've been living a trade-off
Believe your own version
Believe your enslavery and drain out your soul
What can I do when there's so many liars
That crawl through your veins
Like millions of spiders
That seek out their victims
And ruin the wiser
Watch out
Gotcha
Oh my god
I can't deny this
I've been taught just to kill and fight this
To bury it deeper where nobody can find it
Like nobody wanted to know
So give it away
Like they're not gonna fuck you
How long can you bear him
To come back and haunt you
To burn past your feelings
And cause you to suffer
You're starting to bleed
They don't give you up
Before its too late
What will you offer
In way of a healing
I'm so confused, abused, misused
Oh my god
I can't deny this
I've been taught just to kill and fight this
To bury it deeper where nobody can find it
Like nobody wouldn't know
Ooh, if it opens your eyes
This is better than a strong compromise
I was willing to be lost in the shuffle
If only you had let me know
Ooh, if it opens your eyes
This is better than the last compromise
I was willing to be lost in the shadows
If only you had let me know
And they wont give in
Cause they know what they're after
A kick in the face
Like its all that would matter
Ohh
Oh my god
I can't deny this
I've been taught just to murder and fight this
To bury it deeper where no one can find it
Cuz nobody wouldn't know
Ooh, if it opens your eyes
This is better than a good compromise
I was willing to be lost in the shuffle
If only you had let me know
Ooh, well its on with the show
Like the tide down on the ocean
The waves already set in motion
The only one in the game that's lost is you"

And others say that's just me
Some say I'm crazy

Man makes your hair gray
He's your life's mistake

Fall deep in love in the underworld
Raw power is sure to come a-runnin' to you
If you're alone and you got the shakes
So am I baby and I got what it takes
Raw power is sure to come a-runnin' to you
Raw power's got a healing hand
Raw power can destroy a man
Raw power is so more than soul
Got a son called rock and roll.
Raw power, honey, just won't quit
Raw power, I can feel it
Raw power honey, give me a spin
Get up baby and kiss my feet
Ev'rybody always tryin' a tell me what to do
Don't you try, don't you try to tell me what to do
Ev'rybody always tryin' a tell me what to do
Don't you try, don't you try to tell me what to do
Raw power it's got no place to go
Raw power honey, you don't wanna know
Raw power is a guaranteed O.D.
Raw power is a laughin' at you and me
[spoken]
I wanna know
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Raw power
Raw power
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?"
Reckless Life	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/guns_n_roses/reckless_life-lyrics-28039.html	Album: Live Like A Suicide	"I'm reckless and feelin' no pain
You know I've got no need to control
Livin' with the danger
I'm always on the edge now
With million dollar visions that I hold
Livin' like this never ever
Tore my life apart
I know how to maintain
And you know I know my part
On a holiday, a permanent vacation
I'm living on a cigarette with wine
I'm never alone 'cause I've got myself
Yes, I imitate myself all of the time
Livin' like this never ever
Tore my life apart
I know how to maintain
'Cause it's comin' from my heart
I lead a reckless life
And I don't need your advice
I lead a reckless life
And you know it's my only vice
Reckless life
I lead a reckless life
I lead a reckless life
And you know it's my only...
Reckless life
I lead a reckless life
I lead a reckless life
And you know it's my only...
Hey, hey - yeah!"

Jesus don't ya git tired of turnin' tricks
But when your innocence dies
You'll find the blues
Seems all our heroes were born to lose
Just walkin' through time
You believe this heat
Another empty house another dead end street
Gonna rest my bones an sit for a spell
This side of heaven this close to Hell
Right next door to hell
Why don't you write a letter to me yeah
I said I'm right next door to hell
An so many eyes are on me
Right next door to hell
I got nowhere else to be
Right next door to hell
Feels like the walls are closing in on me
My mamma never really said much to me
She was much too young and scared ta be
Hell ""Freud"" might say that's what I need
But all I really ever get is greed
An most my friends they feel the same
Hell we don't even have ourselves to blame
But times are hard and thrills are cheaper
As your arms get shorter
Your pockets get deeper
Right next door to hell
Why don't you write a letter to me yeah
I said I'm right next door to hell
An so many eyes are on me
Right next door to hell
I never thought this is where I'd be
Right next door to hell
Thinkin' time'll stand still for me
***** you

Not bad kids just stupid ones
Yeah we thought we'd own the world
An gettin' used was havin' fun
I said we're not sad kids just lucid ones yeah
Flowin' through life not collectin' anyone

Still so much to see
Time's too much to handle
Time's too much for me
It drives me up the walls
Drives me out of my mind
Can you tell me what this means...huh?"

I can say these things to you

Just like I turned on you
I got a tongue like a razor
A sweet switchblade knife
And I can do you favors
But then you'll do whatever I like
Here I am
And you're a Rocket Queen
I might be a little young
But honey I ain't naive
Here I am
And you're a Rocket Queen, oh yeah
I might be too much
But honey you're a bit obscene
I've seen everything imaginable
Pass before these eyes
I've had everything that's tangible
Honey you'd be surprised
I'm a sexual innuendo
In this burned out paradise
If you turn me on to anything
You better turn me on tonight
Here I am
And you're a Rocket Queen
I might be a little young
But honey I ain't naive
Here I am
And you're a Rocket Queen
I might be too much
But honey you're a bit obscene
I see you standing
Standing on your own
It's such a lonely place for you
For you to be
If you need a shoulder
Or if you need a friend
I'll be here standing
Until the bitter end
No one needs the sorrow
No one needs the pain
I hate to see you
Walking out there
Out in the rain
So don't chastise me
Or think I, I mean you harm
Or those that take you
Leave you strung out
Much too far
Baby, yeah
Don't ever leave me
Say you'll always be there
All I ever wanted
Was for you
To know that I care"

Sail across the sea
Maybe you'll find somebody
That will love you half as much as me
My heart is always with you
No matter what you do
So sail away sweet sister
Cause I'll always be in love with you
But let her be somebody else's queen
I don't want to know about you
Cuz too many others know what I mean
And that's why I got to live without you
I'm in love with a girl
Been talkin' about
I'm in love with a girl
That I can't live without
I'm in love but it feels like
I'm livin' it out
I'm in love but I think I picked a Bad Time
To be in love"

Lets drink to the lowly of birth.
Raise your glass to the good and the evil,
Lets drink to the salt of the earth.
Say a prayer for the common foot soldier,
Spare a thought for his back breaking work.
Say a prayer for his wife and his children,
Who burn the fires and who still till the earth.
And when I search a faceless crowd,
A swirling mass of gray and black and white.
They don't look real to me,
In fact, they look so strange.
Raise your glass to the hard working people,
Lets drink to the uncounted heads.
Lets think of the wandering millions,
Who need leaders but get gamblers instead.
Spare a thought for the stay at home voter,
His empty eyes gaze at strange beauty shows.
And a parade of the gray suited grafters,
A choice of cancer or polio.
And when I search a faceless crowd,
A swirling mass of gray and black and white.
They don't look real to me,
In fact, they look so strange.
Lets drink to the hard working people,
Lets think of the lowly of birth.
Spare a thought for the rag taggy people,
Sets drink to the salt of the earth.
Lets drink to the hard working people,
Lets drink to the salt of the earth.
Lets think of the two thousand million,
Lets think of the humble of birth."

I can feed your bounty, yeah
If you feed my head as well
And I won't give you empty promises, yeah
When the quarter's in the wishing well
But this ain't no sentimental movie
Where dreams collect like dust
You talk to me with innocence in your eyes
So now, who can you trust
You think you look so cool
Yes you do
You take me for your fool, yeah
Itching' for your... of the hug
Baby I want a new start, but don't you be true, yeah
I can see through your door
You put my head into these walls
You take my heart to the dockside, yeah
You put me in the car
And take me for another ride
But this ain't no sentimental movie
Where dreams collect like dust
You talk to me with innocence in your eyes
So now, who can you trust
Trust
Trust
Put a path on to your veins
And antique and old whore's our new pain, yeah
The tears you cried
All the tears you cried tonight
Yeah
You put me down
But you can't get out of sight
And this ain't no sentimental movie
You push it on
You grab it on
But I don't see the TV
This ain't no sentimental movie
Yeah, see the screen
You're startin' to scream
Abusin' confusin'
Your program's over
This ain't no sentimental movie
Yeah, you look so cool
Don't take me for another one of your scenes
This ain't no sentimental movie
This ain't no sentimental movie

choked on my own cigarette
You can hand me another bottle of whiskey baby
but you aint seen the worst yet
Now I'm reckless, gonna have some fun
and the woman who is dead
who was out alnight, no I'm not the only one
And I ain't standing, never standing
in the shadow of your love
shadow of your love
shadow of your love
shadow of your love
Wrote my changes helplessly
yeah but I got no regrets
Money it was on the table
so I booked with all the bets
Living like a lemon aint so hot
and you aint my idea
of one high-rollin' shot
No I ain't standing, never standing
[Chorus]
Big dark clouds hanging over your head
hope you've heard, baby all I've said
You've been told, what I've said
No use crying, you're as good as dead
Now I'm reckless, gonna have some fun
and the woman who is dead, who is out alright
now  I'm not the only one
And I ain't standing, never standing

You walk a mile in my shoes

It's only how you survive

And then I'll put you in your motherfuckin' place
And you...you can suck my ass
An I think it's so low class
Me...I'm just so concerned
I'm still waitin' for your ass to burn
Ooooh you want a confrontation
I'll give you every fuckin' chance
With your verbal masturbation
Me...I just like to dance
How's that for provocation
I'm just makin' a stance
An I'm tired of the frustration
Of livin' inside of your lies
And I'm wired on indignation
I said somebody's got to die

You know that it's true
All I have I ask of you
I'll be dammed
If it's not true

Get your head down in the sky
Fucking little schemer got yourself a broken heart
Syphilitic preachers baby I know who you are
Parasitic demons sucking acid through your heart

Was as fresh as the bright blue sky

She takes me away to that special place

I'd probably break down and cry
Sweet child o' mine
Sweet love of mine
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder
And the rain
To quietly pass me by
Sweet child o' mine
Sweet love of mine
Where do we go
Where do we go now
Where do we go
Sweet child o' mine
She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where evrything
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place

you know i wouldnt want to be you
now there's a hell i cant describe
so now i wander through my daze
try to find my place
its true these feelings that i've felt
i saved for you and no one else
and though as long as this road seems
i know it's called the street of dreams
but thats not stardust on my feet
it leaves a taste thats bittersweet
thats called the blues
i dont know just what i should do
everywhere i go i see you
although it's what we planned
this much is true i know
what i thought was beautiful dont live inside of you anymore
uh uh
what this means to me is more than i know you believe
what i've got from you now
has cost more than it should for me
what i thought was true before were lies i couldnt see
what i thought was beautiful
is only memories"

You can look but you don't see
The flowers seem to tease you at the    garden
Everybody's there, but you don't seem  to care
What's it with you man, and this
garden
TURNED INTO MY WORST PHOBIA,
A CRAZY MAN'S UTOPIA
IF YOU'RE LOST NO ONE CAN SHOW YA,
BUT IT SURE WAS GLAD TO KNOW YA
ONLY POOR BOYS TAKE A CHANCE,
ON THE GARDEN'S SONG AND DANCE,
FEEL HER FLOWERS AS THEY WRAP AROUND,
BUT ONLY SMART BOYS DO WITHOUT
You can find it all inside
No need to wrestle with your pride
No you ain't losin' your mind
You're just in the garden
They can lead you to yourself
Or you can throw it on the shelf
But you know you can look inside
For the garden
I WASN'T REALLY SCARED
LOST MY VIRGINITY THERE,
TO A GYPSY WITH BLOND HAIR
BUT NOW NO ONE SEEMS TO CARE
LIKE A MOUSE INSIDE A MAZE
WANDERING ROUND 4 DAZE
WITH A SMILE UPON MY FACE,
I NEVER WANNA LEAVE THIS PLACE
ONLY POOR BOYS TAKE A CHANCE,
ON THE GARDEN'S SONG AND DANCE,
FEEL HER FLOWERS AS THEY WRAP AROUND,
BUT ONLY SMART BOYS DO WITHOUT
TURNED INTO MY WORST PHOBIA,
A CRAZY MAN'S UTOPIA
IF YOU'RE LOST NO ONE CAN SHOW YA,

I push on the peddle but you know I go too far
There're parties everywhere that I can see
Usin' myself will be the death of me
Ya see every night I get a call on the telephone
My sweet little baby beggin' me just to come home
But I know that everyday I gotta have me some fun
With Suzy to the left and Sally to my right
I know that I need just more than one

When the night goes on and I seem to see some friends
Now a buck for the car for the gas goes so fast
With friends like that tell me who's gonna last
Well the city's hot but tonight I'm not
I want everything that everybody's got
Not a badge in the pan or a legend hand
Just give me one more, one last dance

Take the car, take the keys
Said my money don't grow on trees
You make me stumble and fall
T'ill I'm bloody at my knees
I climbed back up to find that all my money's gone
Too much too soon not know since it's been so long
You can drive me to the edge but I really don't mind
Ya see when I'm in my car I leave you behind
There's another girl that's waitin' down the road
When I'm out the door you know that's just where I'll go

Said it's too much too fast
I don't care if I won't last
Said it's too much too soon
I don't care, get outta my room
Said it's too much too fast
I don't care if I won't last
Said it's too much too soon
I don't care, get outta my room
Said it's too much too fast
I don't care if I won't last
Said it's too much too soon
I don't care, get outta my room
Said it's too much too fast
I don't care if I won't last
Said it's too much too soon
I don't care, get outta my room"

Wil U Hold Me	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/guns_n_roses/wil_u_hold_me-lyrics-161976.html	-	"Sometimes I wonder what you think of me
and it is plane to see that you dont really care
how I feel or even if our loves real
you seem to only care about my outlook
around you
what I look like and the things I do
I try to make you smile
and show you all my love
in hopes you mght stay awhile
will you hold my hand when I cry
or sing me one last song goodbye
this is how you broke my heart
right from the very start
this is my heart
to you it breaks
just take it
and dont break it"
Wild Horses	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/guns_n_roses/wild_horses-lyrics-28121.html	Album: Chinese Democracy	"Childhood living is easy to do
The things you wanted
I bought them for you graceless lady
You know who I am
You know I can't let you slide through my hand
Wild horses
Couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses
Couldn't drag me away
I watched you suffer
A dull aching pain
Now you're decided
To show me the same
No sweeping exits
Or offstage lines
Could make me feel bitter
Or treat you unkind
I know I've dreamed you
A sin n' a lie
I have my freedom
But I dont have much time
Faith has been broken
Tears must be cried
Let's do some living
After we die
Wild horses
Couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses
Couldn't drag me away"
Yesterdays	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/guns_n_roses/yesterdays-lyrics-28081.html	Album: Use Your Illusion II	"Yesterday
There was so many things
I was never told
Now that I'm startin' to learn
I feel I'm growing old
'Cause yesterday's got nothin' for me
Old pictures that I'll always see
Time to spin the pages
In my book of memories
Prayers in my pocket
And no hand in destiny
I'll keep on movin' along
With no time to plant my feet
'Cause yesterday's got nothin' for me
Old pictures that I'll always see
Some things could be better
If we'd all just let them be
Ooh yesterday's got nothin' for me
Yesterday's, Ooh got nothin' for me
Got nothin' for me, yeah
Yesterday
There was so many things
I was never shown
Suddenly this time I found
I'm on the streets and I'm all alone
Yesterday's got nothin' for me
Old pictures that I'll always see
I ain't got time to reminisce old novelties
Ooh yesterday's got nothin' for me
Yesterday's, Ooh got nothin' for me
Yesterday's got nothin' for me
Yesterday
Yesterday"
You Ain't The First	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/guns_n_roses/you_aint_the_first-lyrics-28068.html	Album: Use Your Illusion I	"I tried so hard just to get through to you
But your head's so far
from the realness of truth
Was it just a come on in the dark
Wasn't meant to last long
I think you've worn your welcome honey
I'll just see you along as I sing you this song
Time can pass slowly,
things always change
You day's been numbered
And I've read your last page
You was just a temporary lover
Honey you ain't the first
Lots of others came before you woman
Said but you been the worst
Sa' you been the worst
So goodbye to you girl
So long, farewell
I can't hear you cryin'
Your jivin's been hell
So look for me walkin'
Down your street at night
I'll be in with another
Deep down inside
DEEP DOWN INSIDE"
You Can't Put Your Arms Around A Memory	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/guns_n_roses/you_cant_put_your_arms_around_a_memory-lyrics-161980.html	Album: The Spaghetti Incident?	"It doesn't pay to try,
All the smart boys know why,
It doesn't mean, I didn't try,
I just never know, why.
It's isn't 'cause I'm all alone
Oh, baby, you're not home.
And when I'm home
Big deal, I'm still alone.
It's so restless, I am,
Beat my head against a pole
Try to knock some sense, down 'side my bones.
And even though it don't show,
Those guys are so old.
Can't put your arms around a memory,
Can't put your arms around a memory,
Can't put your arms around a memory.
Don't try
Don't try
You're just a basket case.
And you got no name.
Could you live with me ?
Go on and say.
And even though it don't show
Those guys are so old.
Can't put your arms around a memory,
Can't put your arms around a memory.
Can't put your arms around a memory.
Don't try
Don't try
Johnny you're me
Yeah, you're memory
I wanna put my arms around your memory
I can't try.. I can't try, don't try."
You Could Be Mine	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/guns_n_roses/you_could_be_mine-lyrics-28090.html	Album: Use Your Illusion II	"I'm a cold heartbreaker
Fit ta burn and I'll rip your heart in two
An I'll leave you lyin' on the bed with your ass in the air
I'll be out the door before ya wake
It's nuthin' new ta you
'Cause I think *we've seen that movie too
'Cause you could be mine
But you're way out of line
With your ***** slap rappin'
And your cocaine tongue
You get nuthin' done
I said you could be mine
Now holidays come and then they go
It's nothin' new today
Collect another memory
When I come home late at night
Don't ask me where I've been
Just count your stars I'm home again
'Cause you could be mine
But you're way out of line
With your ***** slap rappin'
And your cocaine tongue
You get nuthin' done
I said you could be mine
You've gone sketchin' too many times
Why don't ya give it a rest
Why
Must you find
Another reason to cry
While you're breakin' down my back n'
I been rackin' out my brain
It don't matter how we make it
'Cause it always ends the same
You can push it for more mileage
But your flaps r' wearin' thin
And I could sleep on it 'til mornin'
But this nightmare never ends
Don't forget to call my lawyers
With ridiculous demands
An you can take the pity so far
But it's more than I can stand
'Cause this couchtrip's gettin' older
Tell me how long has it been
'Cause 5 years is forever
An you haven't grown up yet
You could be mine
But you're way out of line
With your ***** slap rappin'
And your cocaine tongue
You get nuthin' done
I said you could be mine
You should be
You could be mine
Yeah!"
