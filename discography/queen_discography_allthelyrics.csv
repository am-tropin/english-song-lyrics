'39	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/39-lyrics-56157.html	Live Killers	"In the year of thirty-nine' assembled here the volunteers
In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
The sweetest sight ever seen.
and the night followed day, and the story tellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas
Never looked back, never feared, never cried
Don't you hear my call, though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you, write your letters in the sand
For the day I'll take your hand, in the land that our grand-children knew
In the year of thirty-nine', came a ship from the blue
The volunteers came home that day, and they bring good news
Of a world so newly born, though their hearts so heavily weigh
For the earth is old and grey, little darling we'll away
But my love this cannot be...
Oh so many years have gone, though I'm older than a year
Your mothers eyes from your eyes cry to me
Don't you hear my call, though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand, for the day I'll take your hand
In the land that our grand-children knew
Don't you hear my call, though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you, all your letters in the sand
Cannot heal me like your hand, for my life still ahead... pity me"

They were talking in whispers
In bear skins and fur

To have laboured so long
To have made it this far
Ooh it's been such a long ride
Ooh you know it's been a long way

To a human human
With a human body you see

Today is surprisingly fair
Oh oh oh oh woo woo
We've got problems the lone ranger can't fix
The invisible man couldn't see
It takes a tough guy
To learn some new tricks
Ooh it takes such a long time
Ooh you know it's been such a long way

One golden glance of what should be...
It's a kind of magic
One shaft of light that shows the way

This flame that burns inside of me
I'm here in secret harmonies... It's a kind of magic

A Winter's Tale	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/a_winters_tale-lyrics-56025.html	Made In Heaven	"It's Winter-fall, Red skies are gleaming, oh
Sea-gulls are flying over, Swans are floating by
Smoking chimney-tops, am I dreaming
Am I dreaming?
The nights draw in
There's a silky moon up in the sky, yeah
Children are fantasizing, Grown-ups are standing by
What a super feeling, am I dreaming
Am I dreaming?
Wo, wo, wo, wo
(dreaming) So quiet and peaceful
(dreaming) Tranquil and blissful
(dreaming) There's a kind of magic in the air
(dreaming) What a truly magnificient view
(dreaming) A breathtaking scene
With the dreams of the world in the palm of your hand
(dreaming) A cosy fireside chat
(dreaming) A little this, a little that
(dreaming) Sound of merry laughter skipping by
(dreaming) Gentle rain beating on my face
(dreaming) What an extraordinary place!
And the dream of the child is the hope -of the hope- of the man
It's all so beautiful, like a landscape painting in the sky, yeah
Mountains are zooming higher, mmm
Little girls scream and cry
My world is spinning, and spinning, and spinning
It's unbelievable, sends me reeling
Am I dreaming, Am I dreaming
Oooh it's bliss"
Action This Day	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/action_this_day-lyrics-56030.html	Hot Space	"This street honey is a mean street
Living in this street honey needs a mean streak
We've got criminals living in this street
But there's a heart beat pulse, That keeps on pumping
Like a juke box playing the same dead record
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I got a feeling this world is using me
This town honey is a dead town
Living in this town honey is a let down
Coming to this town honey is a show down
But there's a heart beat pulse
That keeps on pumping some sunshine ray
Through a crack in the shutter
Or a sight of a light, at the end of a tunnel
Still there's a feeling this world is using me
Action this day, action this night
Oh we've gotta learn, to love, to live
You can't say it ain't right
Action this day, action this night
Oh you've got the power, you've got the power
You've got the power to love, to live
You can't say it ain't right
Your mind honey is a bleak place
Living in your minds living in a blank space
Your mind is coming from a rat race
But there's a heart beat pulse, That keeps on pumping
Like a juke box playing the same dead record
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I got a feeling that just won't quit
This world is using me
Action this day, action this night
Oh we've gotta learn, to love, to live
We can't say it ain't right
Action this day, action this night
Oh you've got the power, you've got the power
You've got the power to love, to live
You can't say it ain't right

So much ado about nothing, is what she's try to say
So much ado my lover,
so many games we played
Through every fleeted summer, through every precious day
All dead, all dead, all the dreams we had
And I wonder why I still live on
All dead, all dead, and alone I'm spared
My sweeter half instead, All dead, and gone, all dead
All dead, all dead, at the rainbow's end
And still I hear her own sweet song
All dead, all dead, Take me back again
You know my little friend's, all dead and gone
Her ways are always with me, I wander all the while
But please you must forgive me, I am old but still a child
All dead, all dead, but I should not grieve
In time it comes to everyone, all dead, all dead
But in hope I breathe, of course I don't believe
You're dead and gone, all dead and gone"

Another Rainy Night (Without You)	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/another_rainy_night_without_you-lyrics-573358.html	-	"Don't slam the door, on your way out
Don't leave without saying goodbye.
Another long distance night alone,
you leave me wanting, always leave me wanting more.
Last word today, coming home to stay?
Wouldn't that be nice, for a while?
But now my take-out food is growing cold,
and the candle's burned a hole in the floor.
And I'm still waiting for the ring of the phone.
I'm all alone
It's just another rainy night, without you.
Guess I'll leave a light on for you.
It's just another rainy night, without you.
Listen, there's a foghorn blowing
from the coast tonight
Remember making love in the rain?
Strange how laughter looks like crying with no sound
Raindrops taste like tears without the pain.
I'm not much without you, can't leave
if I wanted to. maybe that's why you stay around
But tonight I'll sit here tending the fire
and pace the floor one hundred times in an hour.
And check the voice-mail for a message you've called.
I'm all alone
It's just another rainy night, without you.
Waiting by the phone. Alone.
It's just another rainy night, without you.
Guess I'll leave a light on for you.
I know I've said it before
hate the sound of the closing door
and your footsteps walking away.
(solo)
But now my take-out food is growing cold,
and the candle's burned a hole in the floor.
And I'm still waiting for the ring of the phone.v
I'm all alone
It's just another rainy night, without you.
Waiting by the phone. Alone.
And it's another rainy night, without you.
Guess I'll leave a light on for you.
It's just another rainy night, another rainy night,
another rainy night without you."

Back To Humans	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/back_to_humans-lyrics-1122547.html	-	"It's a Machine's world
Don't tell me I ain't got no soul
When the machines take over
It ain't no place for you and me.
They tell me I don't care
But deep inside I'm just a man
They freeze me they burn me
They squeeze me they stress me
With smoke-blackened pistons of steel they compress me
But no-one, but no-one, but no-one can wrest me away
Back to Humans.
We have no disease, no troubles of mind
No thank you please, no regard for the time
We never cry, we never retreat
We have no conception of love or defeat.
What's that Machine noise
It's bytes and megachips for tea
It's that Machine, boys
With Random Access Memory
Never worry, never mind
Not for money, not for gold.
It's software it's hardware
It's heartbeat is time-share
It's midwife's a disk drive
It's sex-life is quantised
It's self-perpetuating a parahumanoidarianised.
Back to Humans
Back to Humans.
Back to Machines.
Living in a new world
Thinking in the past
Living in a new world
How you gonna last
Machine world...
It's a Machine's world...
Change.
Back to Humans."
Back To The Light	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/back_to_the_light-lyrics-500651.html	-	"Far, far from the light
Here the night creatures call
In the cold breath they howl
And the hollow tears, they're calling you
I'll be there, though maybe you wont see my babe
I'll still care, no mater where I'll still be there
When you make to the other side
Lord I'm going back, back to the light
Back to the dreams that are paved with gold
Back to the light
Back to the land, where the sunshine heals my soul
Deep, deep in the night
When the world fils with tears
And the wind grows, colder and colder it grows
And the fire dimes, with the same old fears
I'll be there, no matter what you're going through
In the dark I care, I'm holding on, I'm hoping on
It's still the same old me inside#
Lord I'm going back, back to the light
Back to the dreams that are paved with gold
Back to the light
Back to the land, where the sunshine heals my soul
On and on, searching for the clearer view
Winning and loosing an inner war
Wondering what we do it for
Though the road seems never ending
Hold on to the hope I'm sending through
No matter where you're going to
I'll be there
I'm holding on, believe it
We'll be walking in the light
?cos there'll be no place left to hide
Back to the light
Back to the dreams that are paved with gold
Back to the light
Back to the land, where the sunshine heals my soul
Let me hear you babes - yeah, yeah, yeah"

Un sueño me envolvio
This dream was me and you
Tal vez estas aqui
I want all the world to see
Un instinto me guiaba
A miracle sensation
My guide and inspiration
Now my dream is slowly coming true
The wind is a gentle breeze
El me hablo de ti
The bells are ringing out
El canto vuela
They're calling us together
Guiding us forever
Wish my dream would never go away
Barcelona - It was the first time that we met
Barcelona - How can I forget
The moment that you stepped into the room you took my breath away
Barcelona - La musica vibro
Barcelona - Y ella nos unio
And if God willing we will meet again someday
Let the songs begin
Dejalo nacer
Let the music play
Ahhhhhhhh...
Make the voices sing
Nace un gran amor
Start the celebration
Van a mi
And cry
Grita
Come alive
Vive
And shake the foundations from the skies
Ahhh ,Ahhh, Shaking all our lives
Barcelona - Such a beautiful horizon
Barcelona - Like a jewel in the sun
Por ti sere gaviota de tu bella mar
Barcelona - Suenan las campamas
Barcelona - Abre tus puertas al mundo
If God is willing
If God is willing
If God is willing
Friends until the end
Viva - Barcelona"

Body Count	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/body_count-lyrics-500648.html	-	"(berry/buck/mills/stipe)
All the young kids learn to dance in the combat zone
Never dared to take a chance
Goin' home alone
But it gets so fucky cold
When it's late at night
Leave the foxholes on their own
Do you sleep well at night?
Body count, feeling hot
Body count, keeping warm
Friends are playing with danger
They don't know where it's found
With their casual letters
It's just another chain
You've lost the innocence
That you've never found
Standing in the dmz
Don't get turned around
(chorus)
Body count, feeling hot
Body count, vietnam
It's not the game, it's a scar
And they won't let you wear your khakis
And your izods anymore
You can go get shot to hell
They don't want you anymore because
All the young kids learn to dance in the combat zone
Never dare to take a chance
You're going home alone
Military metaphors
Are metaphors no more
Keeping up with protocol
You're dancin? off to war
(repeat chorus)
Do you sleep well at night?
Body count, vietnam
They can say what they want
But you have your doubts
It's not what you've lost
It's what your without
When I ran so far
And they just turned away
I doesn't bother me by the light of day
But at night, I hear your call
Late at night, I hear your call
I saw the mirror that you broke today
I saw the ceiling falling down your way
When they looked at you, you could turn away
You didn't bother then by the light of day, you'll stay
But at night, I hear your call
Late at night, I hear your call
You said that you could turn away
I knew that you going to stay
The walls are falling all around
They pinned you down onto the ground
But at night, I hear your call
Vietnam, I hear you call"

Bohemian Rhapsody	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/bohemian_rhapsody-lyrics-56144.html	Live At Wembley '86	"Is this the real life, is this just fantasy
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes , look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me
...to me
Mama, just killed a man, put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama oooh... Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come, sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama oooh (any way the wind blows)
I don't want to die, I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, scaramouche, will you do the Fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning, very very frightening me
Galileo (Galileo)
Galileo (Galileo)
Galileo figaro (Magnifico)
But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go, will you let me go
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go, let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go, let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go, let me go
Will not let you go, let me go
Will not let you go let me go
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby, can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right out of here
Nothing really matters, anyone can see

Breakthru	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/breakthru-lyrics-56269.html	Innuendo	"When love breaks up
When the dawn light wakes up
A new life is born - oooooh
Somehow I have to make this final breakthru . . . now!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
I wake up
Feel just fine
Your face
Fills my mind
I get religion quick
'Cos you're looking divine
Honey you're touching something, you're touchin' me
I'm under your thumb, under your spell, can't you see ?
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru - oh yeah
Breakthru, these barriers of pain
Breakthru, yeah, to the sunshine from the rain
Make my feelings known towards you
Turn my heart inside and out for you now
Somehow I have to make this final breakthru
Now! (now now now)
Oh yeah
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Your smile
Speaks books to me
I break up
With each and every one of your looks at me
Honey you're starting something deep inside of me
Honey you're sparking something, this fire in me
I'm outta control, I wanna rush headlong into this ecstasy
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you - ooh ooh ooh ooh
That would really be a breakthru
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru
Oh yeah
Breakthru, breakthru
Break, hey
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you - ooh ooh ooh ooh

Brighton Rock	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/brighton_rock-lyrics-56195.html	Live Killers	"Happy little day Jimmy went away
Met his little Jenny on a public holiday
A happy pair they made so decorously laid
'Neath the gay illuminations all along the promenade
""It's so good to know there's still a little magic in the air
I'll weave my spell""
-""Jenny will you stay tarry with me pray
Nothing 'ere need come between us
Tell me love what do you say?""-
-""Oh no I must away to my mum in disarray
If my mother should discover how I spent my holiday
It would be of small avail to talk of magic in the air
I'll say farewell""-
Oh rock of ages do not crumble, love is breathing still
Oh lady moon shine down, a little people magic if you will
Jenny pines away writes a letter every day
-""We must ever be together, nothing can my love erase""-
-""Oh no I'm compromised
I must apologize if my lady should discover how I spent my holidays""-"

She drives my crazy, she gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat

Get on my track's, take a back seat
Hitch hike, and take a long ride on my motor bike
Until I'm ready, crazy little thing called love

Get on my track's, take a back seat

Death On Two Legs (Dedicated To......)	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/death_on_two_legs_dedicated_to-lyrics-56168.html	Live Killers	"You suck my blood like a leech, you break the law and you preach
Screw my brain till it hurts, you've taken all my money
And you want more...
Misguided old mule with your pig headed rules
With your narrow minded cronies, who are fools of the first division
Death on two legs, you're tearing me apart
Death on two legs, you've never had a heart of your own
Kill joy, bad guy, big talking, small fry
You're just an old barrow boy
have you found a new toy to replace me? Can you face me?
But now you can kiss my ass goodbye
Feel good, are you satisfied? Do you feel like, suicide?(I think you should)
Is your conscience all right Does it plague you at night?
Do you feel good feel good?
You talk like a big business tycoon, you're just a hot air balloon
So no-one gives you a damn, you're just an overgrown schoolboy
Let me tan your hide
A dog with disease, you're the king of the 'sleaze'
Put your money where your mouth is, mister know-all
Was the fin on your back part of the deal? (Shark)
Death on two legs, you're tearing me apart
Death on two legs, You've never had a heart (you never did)
of your own (Right from the start)
Insane you should be put inside
You're a sewer rat decaying in a cesspool of pride
Should be made unemployed, then make yourself null and void
Make me feel good I feel good"

That's all right
Delilah, Delilah
Oh my, oh my, oh my, you're unpredictable
You make me so very happy
When you cuddle up and go to sleep beside me
And then you make me slightly mad
When you pee all over my Chippendale suite
Delilah, Delilah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You take over my house and home
You even try to answer my telephone
Delilah you're the apple of my eye
Meeow, meeow.... meeow!

Oh you make me so very happy
You give me kisses and I go out of my mind oooh

It's the fantastic drowse, of the afternoon Sundays
That bored you to rages of tears, the unending pleadings
To waste all your good times, In thoughts of your middle-aged years
It's the vertical hold all the things that you're told
For the everyday hero it all turns to zero, and there's all the more reason
For living or dying when you're young, and your troubles are all very small
Out here on the street we'd gather and meet, and scuff up the sidewalk
With endlessly restless feet, half on the time we'd broaden our minds
More in the pool hall, than we did in the school hall
With the down town chewing gum bums
watching the night life the lights and the fun
Never wanted to be the boy next door, always thought I'd be something more
But it ain't easy for a small town boy, It ain't easy at all
Thinking it right and doing it wrong, It's easier from an arm chair
Waves of alternatives wash over my sleepiness
Have my eggs poached for breakfast I guess
I think I'll be Clint Eastwood, Jimi Hendrix he was good
Let's try William the Conqueror, now who else do I like?"
Fat Bottomed Girls	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/fat_bottomed_girls-lyrics-56087.html	Greatest Hits III	"Are you gonna take me home tonight
Ah down beside that red firelight
Are you gonna let it all hang out
Fat bottomed girls, you make the rocking world go round
Hey I was just a skinny lad, never knew no good from bad
But I knew life before I left my nursery
Left alone with big fat Fanny, she was such a naughty nanny
Heap big woman you made a bad boy out of me, Hey hey!
I've been singing with my band, across the wire across the land
I seen every blue eyed floozy on the way
But their beauty and their style, went kind of smooth after a while
Take me to them dirty ladies every time
Oh won't you take me home tonight? Oh down beside your red firelight
Oh and you give it all you got
Fat bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round
Fat bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round
Hey listen here
Now your mortgages and homes, I got stiffness in the bones
Ain't no beauty queens in this locality (I tell you)
Oh but I still get my pleasure, still got my greatest treasure
Heap big woman you gonna make a big man out of me
Now get this...
Oh you gonna take me home tonight (please)
Oh down beside your red firelight, Oh you gonna let it all hang out

Father To Son	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/father_to_son-lyrics-56212.html	Queen II	"A word in your ear, from father to son
Hear the word that I say, I fought with you
Fought on your side, long before you were born
Joyful the sound, the word goes around
From father to son to son...
and the voice is so clear
Time after time it keeps, calling you, calling you on
Don't destroy what you see, your country to be
Just keep building on the ground, that's been won
Kings will be crowned, the word goes around
From father to son to son...
Won't you hear us sing
Our family song? Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Now we hand it on, but I've heard it all before
Take this letter that I give you, take it sonny hold it high
You won't understand a word that's in it
But you'll write it all again before you die
A word in your ear, from father to son
Funny you don't hear, a single word that I say
But my letter to you, will stay by your side
Thru' the years, till the loneliness is gone
Sing if you will, but the air you breathe, I live to give you
Father to son father to son, father to son father to son
Joyful the sound, Word goes around
Father to son, to son
Kings will be crowned, Earth goes around
Father to son to son"

He says I'll have you seeing double
Mesmerize you when he's tongue
tied
Simply with those eyes oooh
Synchronize your minds and see
The beast within him rise
Don't look back, don't look back
It's a rip off
Flick of the wrist and you're dead baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad
Flick of the wrist, he'll eat your heart out
A dig in the ribs, and then a kick in the head
He's taken an arm and taken a leg
All this time honey, baby you've been had
Intoxicate your brain with what I'm saying
If not you'll lie in knee deep trouble
Prostitute yourself he says
Castrate your human pride oooh
Sacrifice your leisure days
Let me squeeze you 'till you've dried
Don't look back don't look back
It's a rip off
Work my fingers to my bones
I scream with pain I still make no impression
Seduce you with his money make machine
Cross collateralise big time money money
Reduce you to a muzak fake machine
Then the last goodbye, It's a rip off
Flick of the wrist and you're dead baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad
Flick of the wrist he'll eat your heart out
A dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head
He's taken an arm and taken a leg
All this time honey baby you've been had"

I am the one the only one, I am the god of kingdom come
Gimme the prize, just gimme the prize
Give me your kings let me squeeze then in my hands
Your puny princes, Your so called leaders of your land
I'll eat them whole before I'm done

Good Company	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/good_company-lyrics-56149.html	A Night At The Opera	"Take good care of what you've got, my father said to me
As he puffed his pipe and baby B, He dandled on his knee
Don't fool with fools who'll turn away, Keep all good company
Oohoo oohoo
Take care of those you call your own and keep good company
Soon I grew and happy too, my very good friends and me
We'd play all day with Sally J, the girl from number four
And very soon I begged her, won't you keep me company?
Oohoo oohoo, oohoo oohoo, come marry me for evermore
We'll be good company
Now marriage is an institution sure
My wife and I our needs and nothing more
All my friends by a year, by and by, disappeared
But we're safe enough behind our door
I flourished in my humble trade my reputation grew
The work devoured my waking hours but when my time was through
Reward of all my efforts, my own Limited Company
I hardly noticed Sally as we parted company
All through the years in the end it appears
There was never really anyone but me
Now I'm old I puff my pipe but no-one's there to see
I ponder on the lesson of my life's insanity
Take care of those you call your own
And keep good company"

Think of me always, I love you, love you

Dining at the Ritz we'll meet at nine precisely

I will pay the bill you taste the wine
Driving back in style in my saloon will do quite nicely
Just take me back to yours that will be fine

don't believe all you read in the Bible
You sinners get in line, saints you leave far behind,
very soon you're gonna be his disciple
Don't listen to what mama says, not a word, not a word mama says
Or else you'll find yourself being the rival, the great Lord before he died
Knelt sinners by his side, and said you're going to realise tomorrow
No I'm not gonna tell you, What you already know
Because time and time again, The old man said it all a long time ago
Come come on the time is right, This evil man will fight

I say hello Mary Lou (goodbye heart)
Sweet Mary Lou I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou we'd never part
So hello Mary Lou (goodbye heart)
You passed me by one sunny day
Flashed those big brown eyes my way
Ooh, I wanted you forever more
Hey, I'm not one that get's around
Swear my feet stuck to the ground
And though I never did see you no more
Yeah neah
I said hello Mary Lou (goodbye heart)
Sweet Mary Lou I'm so in love with you
Hey, I knew Mary Lou we'd never part
So hello Mary Lou (goodbye heart)
So hello Mary Lou (goodbye heart)
One more time
Yes, hello Mary Lou (goodbye heart)
Hey, wait a minute
One minute
Ah, I need my fucking water
I don't care, let's go
Right, give us the right key for fuck's sake"
Hijack My Heart	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/hijack_my_heart-lyrics-264180.html	Queen	"Just walking down the street
One cloudless sunny day
Just minding my own business
Thinking my thoughts -
nothing much to say
When suddenly I got hit
Imagine my surprise
Your smile came up and zapped
Me right between the eyes
I'd never seen anything to compare
With your smile
I'd never seen anything
That came within miles
My heart got hijacked by you
Stuck in the traffic
Stuck at the lights
What do I see
Some stupid bimbo
In a fast car next to me
She takes off
Imagine my disgust
Like a bat outta hell
I get to eat her dust
I never known anything to compare
With her laugh
I never known anything
That counted by half
My heart got hijacked by you
Hijack my heart (Hijack my heart)
Hijack my heart hijack hijack hijack
Steal my heart
Hijack my heart (Hijack my heart)
Hijack my heart
Look at the city
Look at the streets
What do you see ?
Look at the faces
Of the people - they all wanted me
Suddenly hit by something
They don't get a chance
It comes out of nowhere
Right out of the blue
Cos I've never seen anything
To compare with your smile
I've never seen anything
That came within miles
My heart got hijacked by you
Hijack my heart
Now you got a hold on me
You hijacked my heart
But you won't let me be
Stole my heart
Threw away the key
Ooh baby what's become of me
You hijacked my heart
Now you got a hold on me
You hijacked my heart"
I Can't Live With You	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/i_cant_live_with_you-lyrics-469493.html	Queen Rocks	"I can't live with you, but I can't live without you
I can't let you stay, Oooh, but I can't live if you go away
I don't know just how it goes, all I know is I can't live with you
Yeah I'm having a hard time
I'm walking a fine line between hope and despair
You may think that I don't care
But I travelled a long road to get hold of my sorrow
I tried to catch a dream, but nothing's what it seems
Love is saying baby it's all right
When deep inside you're really petrified
Lover turns to hater on this escalator
I can't live with you, yeah, but I can't live without you
I can't breathe if you stay, but I can't bear you to go away
I don't know what time it is, all I know is I can't live with you
We're stuck in a bad place, we're trapped in a rat race
And we can't escape... maybe, there's been some mistake
We're trying to make a high score, we're walking through a closed door
And nobody's winning, we're just sinning against ourselves
Hold on baby tell me it's all right
Anger's breaking from the hurt inside
Passions screaming hotter
Doing what we gotta do - yeah
I can't live with you, I can't live with you
I can't live, I can't live
I can't, I can't live with you
But baby, I'll never ever, leave you
I can't live with you, but I can't live without you
Cos' I'm in love with you, Oooh, and everything about you
I can't live with you
No I just can't live, I just can't live
I can't live with you
Yeah, and I can't live without you
Through the madness through the tears
We've still got each other for a million years - yeah
Oooh yeah
Yeah - I can't live without you - yeah, yeah
I can't live without you
Yeah, yeah oh, oh, oh
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, I can't live without you

I didn't wanna tell you that you're much too cruel
Did you have to run off with that doggone fool
All I gotta do is think about you
Ev'ry night and day - I go crazy
All I gotta do is get my hands on you
Gotta stay away from me baby
Hey, I wouldn't mind the postman
If the neighbours didn't know
Or the gas man, electric man, the man who fixed the car
I'd have to let it go
But you had to bring me down for a rock 'n' roll clone
Leave me like a sucker standing all alone
You just had to run off with that rolling stone
Go ahead fool
All I gotta do is think about you
Ev'ry night and day - I go crazy
All I gotta do is get my hands on you
You gotta stay away from me baby
So I ain't gonna go see no Rolling Stones - no more - no more

But you been a hurting me
But you know that I'll be watching
Rolling on the floor - next time you're on the T.V.

Written by Queen
When the outside temperature rises
And the meaning is oh so clear
One thousand and one yellow daffodils
Begin to dance in front of you - oh dear
Are they trying to tell you something ?
You're missing that one final screw
You're simply not in the pink my dear
To be honest you haven't got a clue
I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened - happened
It finally happened - ooh woh
It finally happened - I'm slightly mad - oh dear !
Ha ha ha ha ha
I'm one card short of a full deck
I'm not quite the shilling
One wave short of a shipwreck
I'm not my usual top billing
I'm coming down with a fever
I'm really out to sea
This kettle is boiling over
I think I'm a banana tree
Oh dear
I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad (I'm going slightly mad)
It finally happened - happened
It finally happened - uh huh
It finally happened - I'm slightly mad - oh dear !
Uh uh ah ah
Uh uh ah ah
I'm knitting with only one needle
Unravelling fast it's true
I'm driving only three wheels these days
But my dear, how about you ?
I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened
It finally happened - oh yes
It finally happened - I'm slightly mad !
Just very slightly mad !

When I'm holding your wheel, all I hear is your gear
When my hand's on your grease gun, Oh it's like a disease son
I'm in love with my car, gotta feel for my automobile
Get a grip on my boy racer rollbar, such a thrill when your radials squeal
Told my girl I'll have to forget her, rather buy me a new carburetor
So she made tracks saying, this is the end now
Cars don't talk back, they're just four wheeled friends now
When I'm holding your wheel, all I hear is your gear
When I'm cruising in overdrive
Don't have to listen to no run of the mill talk jive
I'm in love with my car, gotta feel for my automobile
I'm in love with my car, string back gloves in my automolove"

Hanging around for someone to call
Oooh they won't come knocking at all
Don't run and hide, even if it hurts you inside
So I said, give as good as you get
If you can't beat them,join them
You'd better do it because it makes you feel good
If you can't beat them,join them
You're never gonna help yourself
Come on, Get up
Sure feels good
Keep your fingers off my money, don't try and pull me down
You're taking me out to wine and dine me
Trying to wind me round and around
Invite me to your little contract, Ha!, Ha!
Rumour has it that you could play dirty
I'll tell you what I'll do about that
I'm playing at the wrong game, yeah!
If you can't beat them, join them
You'd better do it because it makes you feel good
If you can't beat them,join them
You're never gonna help yourself
That's good, play it again
If you can't beat them,join them you'd better do it

All the mistakes we made must be faced today
It's not easy now knowing where to start
While the world we love tears itself apart
I'm just a singer with a song
How can I try to right the wrong
For just a singer with a melody
I'm caught in between
With a fading dream
In my defence what is there to say
We destroy the love - it's our way
We never listen enough never face the truth
Then like a passing song
Love is here and then it's gone
I'm just a singer with a song
How can I try to right the wrong
For just a singer with a melody
I'm caught in between
With a fading dream
I'm just a singer with a song
How can I try to right the wrong
I'm just a singer with a melody
I'm caught in between with a fading dream

How do I try
Do we live or die

Freedom for just one week
Feels good to get away oooh
Tuesday, I saw her down on the beach
I stood and watched a while
And she looked and smiled at me
Wednesday, I didn't see her
I hoped that she'd be back tomorrow
And then on Thursday, my luck had changed
She stood there all alone, I went and asked her name
I never thought that this could happen to me
In only seven days
It would take a hundred or more, for memories to fade
I wish Friday would last for ever
I held her close to me, I couldn't bear to leave her there
Saturday, just twenty four hours
Oh no I'm going back home on Sunday
Oooh so sad alone"

Take a look at all the suffering we breed
So many lonely faces scattered all around
Searching for what they need
Is this the world we created?, What did we do it for?
Is this the world we invaded, against the law?
So it seems in the end, Is this what we're all living for today?
The world that we created
You know that every day a helpless child is born
Who needs some loving care inside a happy home
Somewhere a wealthy man is sitting on his throne
Waiting for life to go by
Is this the world we created?, We made it on our own
Is this the world we devastated, right to the bone?
If there's a God in the sky looking down
What can he think of what we've done
To the world that He created?"

There's no reason for living with a broken heart
This is a tricky situation,
I've only got myself to blame
It's just a simple fact of life, It can happen to anyone
You win - you lose
It's a chance you have to take with love
Oh yeah - I fell in love
And now you say it's over and I'm falling apart
It's a hard life, to be true lovers together
To love and live forever in each others hearts
It's a long hard fight, to learn to care for each other
To trust in one another right from the start
When you're in love
I try and mend the broken pieces, I try to fight back the tears
They say it's just a state of mind, But it happens to everyone
How it hurts - deep inside
When your love has cut you down to size
Life is tough - on your own
Now I'm waiting for something to fall from the skies
And I'm waiting for love
Yes it's a hard life, two lovers together
To love and live forever in each others hearts
It's a long hard fight, to learn to care for each other
To trust in one another - right from the start
When you're in love
Yes it's a hard life
In a world that's filled with sorrow

But there's something inside, that's turning my mind away
Oh how I could love you, if I could let you stay
It's late, but I'm bleeding deep inside
It's late, is it just my sickly pride?
Too late, even now the feeling seems to steal away
So late, though I'm crying I can't help but hear you say
It's late, it's late, it's late
But not too late
The way you love me, is the sweetest love around
But after all this time, the more I'm trying
The more I seem to let you down
Now you tell me you're leaving, and I just can't believe it's true
Oh you know that I can love you, though I know I can't be true
Oh you made me love you, don't tell me that we're through
It's late, but it's driving me so mad
It's late, yes I know but don't try to tell me that it's

We've been so long trying to work it out
I ain't got long - You ain't got long
We gotta know what this life is all about
Too late much too late
You're staring at me
With suspicion in your eye, you say what game are you playing?
What's this that you're saying?, I know that I can't reply
If I take you tonight, is it making my life a lie?
Oh you make me wonder, did I live my life alright?
It's late, but it's time to set me free
It's late, yes I know but there's no way it has to be
Too late, so let the fire take our bodies this night
So late, so let the waters take our guilt in the tide
It's late, it's late, it's late, it's late
It's late, it's late, it's all too late"
Jealousy	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/jealousy-lyrics-56085.html	Jazz	"Oh how wrong can you be?
Oh to fall in love was my very first mistake
How was I to know
I was far too much in love too see?
Oh jealousy look at me now, Jealousy you got me somehow
You gave me no warning, took me by surprise
Jealousy you led me on, you couldn't lose you couldn't fail
You had suspicion on my trail
How, how, how all my jealousy
I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy
Oh how strong can you be, with matters of the heart?
Life is much too short, to while away with tears
If only you could see, just what you do to me
Oh jealousy you tripped me up, Jealousy you brought me down
You bring me sorrow you cause me pain
Jealousy when will you let go?
Gotta hold of my possessive mind, turned me into a jealous guy
How, how, how all my jealousy
I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy
But now it matters not, if I should live or die
Because I'm only left with my own jealousy"
Jesus	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/jesus-lyrics-56213.html	Queen	"And then I saw Him in the crowd
A lot of people had gathered round Him, the beggars shouted the lepers called him
The old man said nothing, he just stared about him
All going down to see the Lord Jesus, all going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down
Then came a man before His feet he fell, unclean said the leper and rang his bell
Felt the palm of a hand touch his head, go now go now you're a new man instead
All going down to see the Lord Jesus, all going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down
It all began with the three wise men, followed a star took them to Bethlehem
And made it heard throughout the land, born was a leader of man
All going down to see the Lord Jesus, all going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down
It all began with the three wise men, followed a star took them to Bethlehem
And made it heard throughout the land, born was a leader of man
All going down to see the Lord Jesus, all going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down"
Keep Passing The Open Windows	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/keep_passing_the_open_windows-lyrics-55995.html	The Works	"This is the only life for me
Surround myself around my own fantasy
You just gotta be strong and believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness cos' love is all you need
Love is all you need
Do you know what it's like to be alone in this world
When you're down and out on your luck and you're a failure?
Wake up screaming in the middle of the night
You think it's all been a waste of time, It's been a bad year
You start believing everything's gonna be alright
Next minute you're down and you're flat on your back
A brand new day is beginning
Get that sunny feeling and you're on your way
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
Do you know how it feels when you don't have a friend
Without a job and no money to spend?, You're a stranger
All you think about is suicide
One of these days you're gonna lose the fight
You'd better keep out of danger - yeah!
That same old feeling just keeps burning deep inside
Keep telling yourself it's gonna be the end
Oh get yourself together, Things are looking better everyday
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
This is the only life for me
Surround myself around my own fantasy
You just gotta be strong and believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness because love is all you need
Love is all you need
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
You just gotta be strong and believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness because love is all you need - yeah
Love is all you need, Baby - love is all you need

Keep Yourself Alive	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/keep_yourself_alive-lyrics-56222.html	Greatest Hits III	"I was told a million times of all the troubles in my way
Tried to grow a little wiser,
little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers, and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started bread and butter for a smile
Well I sold a million mirrors in a shop in Alley Way
But I never saw my face in any window any day
Well they say your folks are telling you to be a superstar
But I tell you just be satisfied to stay right where you are
Keep yourself alive keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and a money honey you'll survive
Well I've loved a million women in a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need to feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger maybe that can be my goal
I was told a million times of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying and get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, same as when I started
Keep yourself alive, keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and a money honey you'll survive
Keep yourself alive, keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and a money to keep me satisfied
Do you think you're better every day?
No I think I'm two steps nearer to my grave
Keep yourself alive, keep yourself alive
You take your time and take more money, Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive
Take you all your time and money
Honey you'll survive"

Huh huh I'm in pretty good shape
The best years of my life are like a supernova
Huh huh perpetual craze I said that
Everybody drank my wine - you get my drift
And then we took a holiday on Khashoggi's ship - well
We really had a good good time they was all so sexy
We was bad we was blitzed
All in all it was a pretty good trip
This big bad sucker with a fist as big as your head
Wanted to get me I said go away
I said kiss my ass honey
He pulled out a gun wanted to arrest me
I said uh uh uh babe
Now listen no-one stops my party
No-one stops my party
No-one no-one no-one stops my party
Just like I said
We were phased we was pissed
Just having a total eclipse
That's good
This one's on me so let us do it just right
This here one party don't get started 'till midnight
Everybody party to the left - party to the right
????? do it all night alright alright
Should I lay my hands on you all right (???????????)
Left - right

Killer Queen	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/killer_queen-lyrics-56192.html	Greatest Hits	"She keeps Moet and Chandon in her pretty cabinet
'Let them eat cake' she says, just like Marie Antoinette
A built in remedy for Khrushchev and Kennedy
And anytime an invitation you can decline
Caviar and cigarettes well versed in etiquette
Extr'ordinarily nice
She's a killer queen gunpowder gelatine, dynamite with a lazer beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind... (anytime)
Recommended at the price Insatiable an appetite (wanna try?)
To avoid complications, she never kept the same address
In conversation, she spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China went down to Geisha Minah
Then again incidentally if you're that way inclined
Perfume came naturally from Paris (naturally)
For cars she couldn't care less, fastidious and precise
She's a killer queen gunpowder gelatine
Dynamite with a lazer beam, guaranteed to blow your mind (anytime)
Recommended at the price, Insatiable an appetite (wanna try?)
Drop of a hat she's as willing as a playful as a pussy cat
Then momentarily out of action, temporarily out of gas
To absolutely drive you wild, wild
She's out to get you
She's a killer queen gunpowder gelatine
dynamite with a lazer beam, guaranteed to blow your mind (anytime)
Recommended at the price, insatiable an appetite (wanna try?)"

Despacito mi amor, Let me know this night and evermore

I come from London town , I'm just an ordinary guy

And I slam the door, and I'm on my way
I won't lay no blame, I won't call you names
Because I've made my break, and I won't look back
I've turned my back, on those endless games
I'm all through with ties, I'm all tired of tears
I'm a happy man, don't it look that way
Shaking dust from my shoes, there's a road ahead
And there's no way back home (no way back home)
Oh but I have to say
Leaving home ain't easy
Oh I never thought it would be easy
Leaving on your own
Oh is the main thing calling me back
Leaving home ain't easy
On the one you're leaving home
Stay my love, my love please stay
Don't stray my love, what's wrong my love?
What's right my love?
Oh leaving home ain't easy
I thought how could I think of leaving
Leaving on your own
Still trying to persuade me that
Leaving home ain't necessarily the only way
Leaving home ain't easy
But may be the only way"

Torsos in my closet, Shadows from my past

Sleeping is my leisure, Waking up in a minefield
Dream in just a pleasure dome, Love is a roulette wheel
Life is real, life is real
Life is real, oh yeah
Success is my breathing space, I brought it on myself
I will price it, I will cash it, I can take it or leave it
Loneliness is my hiding place, Breast feeding myself
What more can I say? I have swallowed the bitter pill
I can taste it, I can taste it
Life is real, life is real
Life is real
Music will be my mistress, Loving like a whore
Lennon is a genius, Living in every pore
Life is real, life is real
Life is real, so real
Life is cruel, life is a bitch

Neptune of the seas an answer for me please

I lie in wait with open eyes
I carry on through stormy skies
I follow every course my kingdom for a horse
But each time I grow old
Serpent of the Nile relieve me for a while
And cast me from your spell and let me go

To tell the king of Rhye he's lost his throne
Wars will never cease
Is there time enough for peace?

Wake up in the morning with a good face, stare at the moon all day
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase, does anyone care anyway?
For all the prayers in heaven, so much of life's this way
Did we leave our way behind us? Such a long long way behind us
Who knows when now who knows where Where the light of day will find us?
Look for the day
Take heart my friend we love you, though it seems like you're alone
A million light's above you, smile down upon your home
Hurry put your troubles in a suitcase, come let the new child play
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase, I'm leaving here,I'm long away
For all the stars in heaven, I would not live I could not live this way
Did we leave our way behind us? Such a long long way behind us
Leave it for some hopeless lane

Such a long long way, I'm looking for
Still looking for that day"

You always had the upper hand
Got caught in love and stepped in sinking sand
You had to go and ruin all our plans
Packed your bags and you're leaving home
Got a one-way ticket and you're all set to go
But we have one more day together, so
Love me like there's no tomorrow
Hold me in your arms, tell me you mean it
This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over
But today just love me like there's no tomorrow
I guess we drift alone in separate ways
I don't have all that far to go
God knows I learnt to play the lonely man
I've never felt so low in all my life
We were born to be just losers
So I guess there's a limit on how far we go
But we only have one more day together so
Love me like there's no tomorrow
Hold me in your arms, tell me you mean it
This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over
But today just love me like there's no tomorrow
Tomorrow god knows just where I'll be
Tomorrow who knows just what's in store for me
Anything can happen but we only have one more day together, yeah
Just one more day forever, so
Love me like there's no tomorrow
Hold me in your arms, tell me you mean it
This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over

It's a machines world, Don't tell me I ain't got no soul
When the machines take over,
It ain't no place for rock and roll
They tell me I don't care, But deep inside I'm just a man
They freeze me, they burn me, They squeeze me, they stress me
With smoke blackened pistons of steel they compress me
But no-one, but no-one but, no-one can wrest me away
Back to humans
We have no disease no trouble of mind
No thank you or please no regard for the time
We never cry we never retreat
We have no conception of love or defeat
What's that machine noise? It's bytes and megachips for tea
It's that machine boys, With random access memory
Never worry, never mind, Not for money not for gold
Its software, is hardware, its heartbeat, is time-share
Its midwife's a disc drive, its sex life, is quantised
It's self-perpetuating a parahumanoidarianised
Back to humans, Back to humans
Back to machines
Machines...
Living in a new world, Thinking in the past
Living in a new world, How you gonna last?
Machine world, Back to humans
It's a machines world, Thinking in the past (back to humans)
Living in a new world, How you gonna last?

A message of love

Come join your hands and sing along
They call me Mad the swine
I guess I'm Mad the swine
I've come to save you, save you
Mad the swine

So all you people gather around
Hold out your hands and praise the Lord
I'll walk upon the water just as before
I'll help the meek and the mild
And believers and the blind
And all the creatures - great and small
Let me take you to the river without a fall
Oh and then one day you'll realise
You're all the same within his eyes
That's all I've come to say just like before
They call me Mad the swine
I'm Mad the swine
I've come to save you, save you

Waiting for possibilities, don't see too many around

When stormy weather comes around it was made in heaven
When sunny skies break through behind the clouds
I wish it could last forever, yeah
Wish it could last forever for ever
Made in heaven
I'm playing my role in history, looking to find my goal
Taking in all this misery, but giving it all my soul
Made in heaven, made in heaven, it was all meant to be
Made in heaven, made in heaven
That's what everybody says wait and see
It was really meant to be so plain to see, yeah
Everybody, everybody, everybody tells me so
Yes it was plain to see yes it was meant to be
Written in the stars, written in the stars
Written in the stars"

Modern Times Rock 'n' Roll	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/modern_times_rock_n_roll-lyrics-56215.html	Queen	"Had to make do with a worn out rock and roll scene
The old bop is getting tired need a rest, well you know what I mean
Fifty eight that was great,
but it's over now and that's all
Something harder's coming up, gonna really knock a hole in the wall
Gonna hit ya grab you hard, make you feel ten feet tall
Well I hope that big new baby's gonna come along soon
You don't know it could happen any old rainy afternoon
With the temperature down, and the juke box blowing no fuse
And my musical life's feeling, like a long Sunday School cruise
And you know there's one thing, every single body could use
Yeah listen to me baby, let me tell you what it's all about
Modern times rock and roll, Modern times rock and roll
Get your high heeled guitar boots and some groovy clothes
Get a hair piece on your chest, and a ring through your nose
Find a nice little man who says, he's gonna make you a real big star
Stars in your eyes ants in your pants, think you should go far
Everybody in this bum sucking world's, gonna know just who you are
Look out...
Modern times rock and roll!!"

Uninspired and lonely

All you're given, is what you've been given
A thousand times before
Just more more
More of that jazz
More, no more of that jazz
Give me no more
No more of that jazz
Only football gives us thrills
Rock'n'roll just pays the bills
Only our team is the real team
Bring out the dogs get on your feet
Lay on the floor
Can't help thinking I've heard that line before
Just more more
More of that jazz
More, no more of that jazz
Give me no more
No more of that jazz
Oh no matter
-Fool got no business hanging round and telling lies-
-Bicycle races are coming your way-
-If you can't beat 'em join them-
-Fun it-
-Oh you're gonna let it all hang out
fat bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round-
No more, no more, no more
Of that jazz"
Mother Love	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/mother_love-lyrics-56154.html	Made In Heaven	"I don't want to sleep with you
I don't need the passion too
I don't want a stormy affair
To make me feel my life is heading somewhere
All I want is the comfort and care
Just to know that my woman gives me sweet mother love
I've walked too long in this lonely lane
I've had enough of this same old game
I'm a man of the world and they say that I'm strong
But my heart is heavy, and my hope is gone
Out in the city, in the cold world outside
I don't want pity, just a safe place to hide
Mama please, let me back inside
I don't want to make no waves
But you can give me all the love that I crave
I can't take it if you see me cry
I long for peace before I die
All I want is to know that you're there
You're gonna give me all your sweet mother love
My body's aching, but I can't sleep
My dreams are all the company I keep
Got such a feeling as the sun goes down
I'm coming home to my sweet mother love"

She winds me up and then lets me go
Turns me on and then tells me no
She's just a pussy cat

My Fairy King	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/my_fairy_king-lyrics-56218.html	Queen	"In the land where horses born with eagle wings, and honey bees have lost their stings
There's singing forever,
lions den with fallow deer, and rivers made from wines so clear
Flow on and on forever, Dragons fly like sparrows thru' the air
And baby lambs where Samson dares... To go on on on on on on
My fairy king can see things, He rules the air and turns the tides
That are not there for you and me, Oooh yeah he guides the winds
My fairy king can do right and nothing wrong, Then came man to savage in the night
To run like thieves and to kill like knives, To take away the power from the magic hand
To bring about the ruin of the promised land
They turn the milk into sour, like the blue in the blood of my veins
Why can't you see it, fire burning in hell with the cry of screaming rain
Son of heaven set me free and let me go, Sea turn dry no salt from sand
Seasons fly no helping hand, Teeth don't shine like pearls for poor man's eyes
Someone someone just drained the colour from my wings, Broken my fairy circle ring
And shamed the king in all his pride, changed the wings and wronged the tides
Mother mercury mercury, look what they've done to me
I cannot run I cannot hide"

And I'm left cold sober
My baby left me for somebody new
I don't wanna talk about it
Want to forget about it
I'm intoxicated with that special brew
So come and get me, let me
Get in that sinking feeling
That says my heart is on an all time low - so
Don't expect me
To behave perfectly
And wear that sunny smile
My guess is I'm in for a cloudy and overcast
Don't try and stop me
'Cause I'm heading for that stormy weather soon
I'm causing a mild sensation
With this new occupation
I'm permanently glued
To this extraordinary mood, so now moveover
And let me take over
With my melancholy blues
I'm causing a mild sensation
With this new occupation
I'm in the news
I'm just getting used to my new exposure
So come into my enclosure
And meet my melancholy blues"

No I'll never find me an answer
You promised me you'd keep in touch
I read your letter and it hurt me so much
I said I'd never never be angry with you
I don't wanna feel like a stranger no
Because I'd rather stay out of danger
I read your letter so many times
I got your meaning between the lines
I said I'd never never be angry with you
I must be strong so she won't know how much I miss her
I only hope as time goes on I'll forget her
My bodies aching can't sleep at night
I'm to exhausted to start a fight
And if I see her with another guy
I'll eat my heart out because I love her
Love her love her love her
Come on baby let's get together
I'll love you baby I'll love you forever
I'm trying hard to stay away
What made you change? What did I say?
Oooh I need your loving tonight
Oooh I need your loving
Oooh I need your loving
Oooh I need your loving babe tonight
Hit me
Oooh I need your loving tonight
No I'll never look back in anger

Can't you see, listen to the breeze, whisper to me please
Don't send me to the path of nevermore
Even the valley's below, where the rays of the sun
Were so warm and tender, Now haven't anything to grow
Can't you see?
Why did you have to leave me? (nevermore)
Why did you deceive me? (nevermore)
You sent me to the path of nevermore
When you say you didn't love me anymore
Ah ah nevermore nevermore"

Is it raining in heaven, do you want us to cry?
And everywhere the broken-hearted, On every lonely avenue
No-one could reach them, No-one but you
One by one
Only the good die young
They're only flying too close to the sun
And life goes on
Without you
Another tricky situation, I get to drowning in the blues
And I find myself thinking, well, what would you do?
Yes, it was such an operation, forever paying every due
Hell, you made a sensation (sensation)
You found a way through (found a way through)
One by one
Only the good die young
They're only flying too close to the sun
We'll remember
Forever
And now the party must be over, I guess we'll never understand
The sense of your leaving, was it the way it was planned?
So we grace another table, and raise our glasses one more time
There's a face at the window
And I ain't never, never saying goodbye
One by one
Only the good die young
They're only flying too close to the sun
Crying for nothing
Crying for no-one
No-one but you"

When the piper is gone, and the soup is cold on the table
And if the black crow flies,
to find a new destination, That is the sign
Come tonight, Come to the ogre site, Come to the ogre battle fight
He gives a great big cry, and he can swallow up the ocean
With a mighty tongue he catches flies, and the palm of his hand incredible size
One great big eye has to focus in your direction, now the battle is on
Yeah yeah yeah! Come tonight, Come to the ogre site, Come to the ogre battle fight
The ogre men are still inside, The two way mirror mountain
You gotta keep down, right out of sight
You can't see in but they can see out, 'keep a look out'
The ogre men are coming out, from the two way mirror mountain
They're running up behind, and they're coming all about
Can't go east because you gotta go south
Ogre men are coming home, the great big fight is over
Bugle blow let trumpet cry, Ogre battle lives for ever more
You can come along, You can come along... Come to ogre battle"

Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life
Oooh, oooh, pain is so close to pleasure everybody knows
One day we love each other then we're fighting one another all the time
When I was young and just getting started
And people talked to me they sounded broken hearted
Then I grew up and got my imagination
And all I wanted was to start a new relation
So in love but love had a bad reaction
I was looking for some good old satisfaction
But pain is all I got when all I needed was some love and affection
Oooh, oooh, pain is so close to pleasure, yeah, yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life
Pain and pleasure, Oooh, oooh, pain and pleasure
When your plans go wrong and you turn out the light
But inside of your mind you have to put up a fight
Where are the answers that we're all searching for
There's nothing in this world to be sure of anymore
Some days you're feeling good some days you're feeling bad
But if you're feeling happy someone else is always sad
Let the sweetness of love wipe the tears from your face
For better for worse so let's make the best of the rest of our years
Oooh oooh pain is so close to pleasure I told you so
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life
Pain and pleasure, Oooh, oooh, pain is so close to pleasure, yeah, yeah

Put Out The Fire	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/put_out_the_fire-lyrics-56028.html	Greatest Hits III	"They called him a hero, In the land of the free
But he wouldn't shake my hand boy, He disappointed me
So I got my hand gun, And I blew him away
That critter was a bad guy, And I had to make him pay
You might fear for my reason, I don't care what they say
Look out baby it's the season, For the mad masquerade
Put out the fire, put out the fire, put out the fire
Oh you need a bullet like a hole in the head
Put out the fire, put out the fire, put out the fire
Don't believe what your grand-daddy said
She was my lover, It was a shame that she died
But the constitution's right on my side
Because I caught my lover in the neighbours bed
I got retribution Filled 'em all full of lead
I've been told it's the fashion, To let me on the streets again
It's nothing but a crime of passion, And I'm not to blame
Put out the fire, put out the fire, put out the fire
You need a weapon like a hole in the head
Put out the fire, put out the fire, baby, put out the fire
And let your sons and daughters sleep sound in their beds
You know a gun never killed nobody, You can ask anyone
People get shot by people, People with guns
Put out the fire, put out the fire, put out the fire
You need a gun like a hole in the head
Put out the fire, put out the fire, put out the fire
Just tell me that old fashioned gun law is dead
Shoot shoot.."
Radio Ga Ga	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/radio_ga_ga-lyrics-56010.html	Innuendo	"I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know,
I heard it on my radio
You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds - invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh - you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there
You had your time you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio
All we hear is Radio ga-ga
Radio goo-goo, Radio ga-ga
All we hear is Radio ga-ga, Radio blah blah
Radio what's new?, Radio someone still loves you
We watch the shows - we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years
Let's hope you never leave old friend
Like all good things on you we depend
So stick around because we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual
You had your time you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio
All we hear is Radio ga-ga
Radio goo-goo, Radio ga-ga
All we hear is Radio ga-ga
Radio goo-goo, Radio ga-ga
All we hear is Radio ga-ga, Radio blah blah
Radio what's new? Someone still loves you

Rain Must Fall	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/rain_must_fall-lyrics-56267.html	The Miracle	"I can see it in your stars
Life is so exciting
Acting so bizzare
Your world is so inviting
Playing really cool
And looking so mysterious honey
Your every day is full of sunshine
But into every life a little rain must fall
No problem
Uh
Be cool now
Anyone who imagines
They can blind you with science
Bully you all over
With property and finance
But you have the position
To call the shots and name the price honey
You found success and recognition
But into every life a little rain must fall
Flo Jo
You lead a fairy tale existance
But into every life a little rain must fall
Be cool
Hah
Kiss kiss
Others seem to think
You are over dramatising
Problems at work
So it's hardly suprising
There's little you can do
To alter their opinions honey
You want a clean reputation
But now you're facing complications
'Cos into every life a little rain must fall
Be cool
Get serious
Alright
Play it nice and cool
Play it nice and cool
That's good
One more time
Aha
I like it"

To end this misery and I wonder
I wah, wah, wah, wah wonder
Why
Why, why, why, why, why she ran away
And I wonder when she will stay
My little runaway a-run, run, run, run, a-runaway

Maybe you'll find somebody, to love you half as much as me
My heart is always with you, no matter what you do
Sail away sweet sister, I'll always be in love with you
Forgive me for what I told you, my heart makes a fool of me
You know that I'll never hold you, I know that you gotta be free
Sail away sweet sister, sail across the sea
Maybe you'll find somebody, to love you half as much as me
Take it the way you want it, but when they let you down my friend
Sail away sweet sister, back to my arms again
Hot child don't you know you're young, you got your whole life ahead of you?
And you can throw it away too soon... Way too soon... Ahh, Ahh, Ahhhh

Save Me	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/save_me-lyrics-56041.html	Greatest Hits	"It started off so well
they said we made a perfect pair
I clothed myself in your glory and your love
How I loved you, How I cried...
The years of care and loyalty
Were nothing but a sham it seems
The years belie, we lived a lie
""I love you till I die""
Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, save me...
I'm naked and I'm far from home
The slate will soon be clean, I'll erase the memories
To start again with somebody new, was it all wasted
All that love?...
I hang my head and I advertise, a soul for sale or rent
I have no heart, I'm cold inside
I have no real intent
Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, save me...
I'm naked and I'm far from home
Each night, I cry, I still believe the lie
""I love you till I die""
Save me, save me, save me
Don't let me face my life alone
Save me, save me, oooh...
I'm naked and I'm far from home"

I'm merely contemplating what you feel inside
Meanwhile I ask you to be my Clementine
You say you will if you could but you can't
I love you madly
Let my imagination (run away) with you gladly
A brand new angle highly commendable
Seaside rendezvous
I feel so romantic can we do it again?
Can we do it again sometime, (I'd like that)
Fantastic, c'est la vie mesdames et messieurs
And at the peak of the season
The Mediterranean (this time of year) it's so fashionable.
I feel like dancing in the rain Can I have a volunteer?
(Just keep right on dancing) What a damn jolly good idea
It's such a jollification as a matter of fact
So 'tres charmant' my dear
Underneath the moonlight, together we'll sail across the sea
Reminiscing every night, meantime I ask you to be my Valentine
You say you'd have to tell your daddy if you can
I'll be your Valentino, we'll ride upon an omnibus and then the casino
Get a new facial start a sensational Seaside rendezvous (so adorable)
Seaside rendezvous (oooh), Seaside rendezvous
Give us a kiss!"

Sleeping On The Sidewalk	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/sleeping_on_the_sidewalk-lyrics-56096.html	News Of The World	"I was nothing but a city boy, my trumpet was my only toy
I've been blowing my horn, Since I knew I was born
But there ain't nobody wants to know
I've been sleeping on the sidewalk, rolling down the road
I may get hungry, but I sure don't want to go home
So round the corner comes a limousine, and the biggest grin I ever seen
Here sonny won't you sign, right along the dotted line
What you saying are you playing, sure you don't mean me?
I've been sleeping on the sidewalk, rolling down the road
I may get hungry, but I sure don't want to go home
(Now I tell you what happened...)
They took me to a room without a table, they said 'blow your trumpet into here'
I played around as well as I was able, and soon we had the record of the year
I was a legend all through the land, I was blowing to a million fans
Nothing was a missing, all the people want to listen
You'd have thought I was a happy man
And I was sleeping like a princess
Never touch the road, I don't get hungry
And I sure don't want to go home (Have to have some fun...)
Now they tell me that I ain't so fashionable
And I owe the man a million bucks a year
So I told them where to stick the fancy label
It's just me and the road from here
I'm back to playing and laying, I'm back on the game
I'm sleeping on the sidewalk, rolling down the road
I sure get hungry and, I sure do wanna go home (Yeah)"

Suspended in time
And don't it make you feel small?
I like to sit here by the fire's light
The trees in the fields lie bare to the night
The stars burn bright
And don't it make you feel small?
Everyone needs a place they can hide
Hide away find a space to be alone
Everyone needs a place they can hide
Everyone needs to find peace sublime
I like to sit here in the Autumn time
The trees in the fields they rustle in the wind
The church bells gently chime
Gentle on your mind
Suspendend in time
And don't it make you feel small?
Everyone needs a place they can hide
Everyone needs to find peace sublime
Oh peace of mind
Everyone needs a place they can hide
Hide away find a space to be alone

But now I think you hear me well, for now we both know how
No star can light our way,
in this cloud of dark and fear
But someday one day...
Funny how the pages turn, and hold us in between
A misty castle waits for you, and you shall be a queen
Today the cloud it hangs, over us and all is grey
But someday one day...
When I was you and you were me, and we were very young
Together took us nearly there, the rest may not be sung
So still the cloud it hangs, over us and we're alone
But some day one day, we'll come home"

Don't wonder how, don't ask me why
But I believed what I'd been told
'All things that glitter can't be gold'
Ooooo ooo yeah
All things that glitter can't be gold
Those jealous minds conspired to say
Just let that creature fly away
How can it be she has it all
Her pride is headed for a fall
Ooooo ooo yeah
All things that glitter can't be gold
Oh Lord, what races we run
Seeking our place in the Sun
Reaching and doping we'll find the right one
Now every day a new joy brings
My butterfly grew golden wings
It seems we find as we grow old
Some things that glitter may be gold
Ooooo ooo yeah
Some things that glitter may be gold
So let us mind what's there to see
Before our hearts become too cold
In spite of all that we've been told
Some things that glitter may be gold
Ooooo ooo yeah
Some things that glitter may be gold
Ooooo ooo yeah
Some things that glitter
May be gold"

Spread Your Wings	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/spread_your_wings-lyrics-56100.html	Live Killers	"Sammy was low, just watching the show
Over and over again, knew it was time
He'd made up his mind,
To leave his dead life behind
His boss said to him, 'Boy you'd better begin
To get those crazy notions right out of your head
Sammy who do you think that you are?
You should've been sweeping up the Emerald bar'
Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together
Because you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man
He spends his evenings alone in his hotel room
Keeping his thoughts to himself he'd be leaving soon
Wishing he was miles and miles away
Nothing in this world, nothing, would make him stay
Since he was small, had no luck at all
Nothing came easy to him
Now it was time he'd made up his mind
'This could be my last chance'
His boss said to him... 'now listen boy
You're always dreaming
You've got no real ambition you won't get very far
Sammy boy, don't you know who you are?
Why can't you be happy at the Emerald bar?'
So honey Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together
Because you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man
Come on honey"

I got reason to believe
That sweet soul magic
Gonna tear my heart in two
Music makes the world go round
I've been flyin' on the wings of the sound
It feels so good from way up here
I'm still a believer

There's a rumour going round ,
gotta clear out of town
I'm smelling like a dry fish bone, here come the law gonna break down the door
Gonna carry me away once more
Never never I never want it anymore
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor
Crazy... stone cold crazy you know
Rainy afternoon I gotta blow a typhoon, and I'm playing on my slide trombone
Anymore anymore cannot take it anymore, Gotta get away from this stone cold floor
Crazy... stone cold crazy you know
Walking down the street, shooting people that I meet, with my rubber Tommy water gun
Here come the deputy, He's gonna come and get me, I gotta get me up and run
They got the sirens loose, I ran right out of juice
They're gonna put me in a cell, if I can't go to heaven , Will they let me go to hell?

And my rock'n'roll forty fives, bin enraging the folks on the lower floor
I got a way with the girls on my block, try my best to be a real individual
And when we go down to smokies and rock, they line up like it's some kind of ritual
Oh give me a good guitar, and you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or just find me an open car, I'll make the speed of light out of this place
I like the good things in life, but most of the best things ain't free
It's the same situation just cuts like a knife
When you're young and you're poor and you're crazy
Young and you're crazy... Oh give me a good guitar
And you can say that my hair's a disgrace, or just find me an open car
I'll make the speed of light out of this place"

the fairy folk have gathered, round the new moon's shine
To see the feller crack a nut,
at night's noon time
to swing his axe he swears, as he climbs he dares
To deliver the master stroke, ploughman wagoner will' and types
Politician with senatorial pipe, He's a dilly dally oh
Pedagogue squinting wears a frown, and a satyr peers under lady's gown
He's a dirty fellow, What a dirty laddie, oh
Tatterdemalion and the junketer, there's a thief and a dragonfly trumpeter
He's my hero ah, Fairy dandy tickling the fancy
Of his lady friend, the nymph in yellow (can we see the master stroke)
What a quaere fellow
Soldier sailor tinker tailor ploughboy, waiting to hear the sound
And the arch magician presides, he is the leader
Oberon and Titania watched by a harridan
Mab is the queen and there's a good apothecary man
Come to say hello, fairy dandy tickling the fancy
Of his lady friend, the nymph in yellow
What a quaere fellow
The ostler stares with hands on his knees, come on mister feller
Crack it open if you please"

Adrift in a world of my own (oooh oooh)
I play the game but to my real shame
You've left me to dream all alone
Too real is this feeling of make believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal
Oooh oooh yes I'm the great pretender (oooh oooh)
Just laughing and gay like a clown (oooh oooh)
I seem to be what I'm not (you see)

Pretending that you're still around

That you just can't place
Feel somethin' move

When something sits
On the end of your bed
Don't turn around
When you hear me tread

Never take me alive

The Loser In The End	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/the_loser_in_the_end-lyrics-56209.html	Queen II	"Mama's got a problem She don't know what to say
Her little baby boy, has just left home today
She's got to be the loser in the end
She's got to be the loser in the end
Misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend
She's ma on whom you can always depend
She washed and fed and clothed and cared
For nearly twenty years
And all she gets is 'Goodbye Ma'
And the night times for her tears
She's got to be the loser in the end
She's got to be the loser in the end
Misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend
She's ma on whom you can always depend
So listen mothers everywhere, to just one mothers son
You'll get forgotten on the way, if you don't let them have their fun
Forget regrets and just remember, it's not so long since you were young
You're bound to be the loser in the end, You're bound to be the loser in the end
They'll chose their new shoes, that's not far to bend
You're ma on whom they can always depend"

Why don't you mean it why do I follow you
And where do you go?
You've never seen nothing like it, no never in your life
Like going up to heaven, and then coming back alive
Let me tell you all about it, Oooh give me a little time to choose
Water babies singing in a lily pool delight
Blue powder monkeys praying in the dead of night
Here comes the Black Queen poking in the pile
Fight for the Black Queen marching single file
Take this take that bring them down to size
The March to the Black Queen
Put them in the cellar with the naughty boys
Little nigger sugar then a rub-a-dub-a baby oil
Black on, black on, every finger nail and toe
We've only begun, begun
Make this, make that, keep making all that noise
Oooh march to the Black Queen
Now I've got a belly full
You can be my sugar baby, you can be my honey chile
A voice from behind me reminds me, spread out your wings you are an angel
Remember to deliver with the speed of light, a little bit of love and joy
Everything you do bears a will, and a why and a wherefore
A little bit of love and joy
In each and every soul lies a man, and very soon he'll deceive and discover
But even to the end of his life, he'll bring a little love
I reign with my left hand, I rule with my right
I'm lord of all darkness, I'm queen of the night
I've got the power, now do The march of the Black Queen
My life is in your hands I'll fo and I'll fire
I'll be what you make me, I'll do what you like
I'll be a bad boy, I'll be your bad boy
I'll do the march of the Black Queen
Walking true to style, she's vulgar abuse and vile
Fight for the Black Queen tattoos all her pies
She boils and she bakes, and she never dots her I's
La la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la
Forget your sing a-longs and your lullabies
Surrender to the city of the fireflies
Dance to the devil in beat with the band
To hell with all of you hand in hand
But now it's time to be gone
La la la la forever forever
Ah ah ah ah ah"

Lucy was high and so was I dazzling, holding the world inside
Once I believed in everyone, everyone and anyone can see
Oh oh the night comes down, and I get afraid of losing my way
Oh oh the night comes down, Oooh and it's dark again
Once I could laugh with everyone, once I could see the good in me
The black and the white distinctively colouring, holding the world inside
Now all the world is grey to me, nobody can see you gotta believe it

The Prophet's Song	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/the_prophets_song-lyrics-56153.html	A Night At The Opera	"Oh oh people of the earth, listen to the warning the seer he said
Beware the storm that gathers here, listen to the wise man
I dreamed I saw on a moonlit stair, spreading his hand to the multitude there
A man who cried for a love gone stale, and ice cold hearts of charity bare
I watched as fear took the old man's gaze, hopes of the young in troubled graves
'I see no day' I heard him say, so grey is the face of every mortal
Oh oh people of the earth! 'Listen to the warning' the prophet he said
For soon the cold of night will fall, Summoned by your own hand
Ah ah children of the land, quicken to the new life take my hand
Fly and find the new green bough, return like the white dove
He told of death as a bone white haze, taking the lost and the unloved babes
Late too late all the wretches run, these kings of beasts now counting their days
From mother's love is the son estranged, married his own his precious gain
The earth will shake in two will break, and death all round will be your dowry
Oh oh people of the earth, listen to the warning the seer he said
For those who hear and mark my words, Listen to the good plan
Oh oh oh oh, and two by two, my human zoo, (they'll be)
Running for to come, running for to come, out of the rain
Oh flee for your lives who heed me not, let all your treasures make
Oh you fear for your life, deceive you not the fires of hell will take you
Should death await you...
Ah people can you hear me?
And now I know, and now I know
And now I know, and now I know
That you can hear me
And now I know and now I know
And now I know now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know

The Show Must Go On	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/the_show_must_go_on-lyrics-56238.html	Innuendo	"The Show Must Go On
Written by Queen
Empty spaces - what are we living for
Abandoned places - I guess we know the score
On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for...
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore
The show must go on
The show must go on, yeah
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on
Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance
On and on, does anybody know what we are living for ?
I guess I'm learning (I'm learning learning learning)
I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning (turning turning turning)
Round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free
The show must go on
The show must go on, yeah yeah
Ooh, inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on
Yeah yeah, whoa wo oh oh
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die
I can fly - my friends
The show must go on (go on, go on, go on) yeah yeah
The show must go on (go on, go on, go on)
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On - with the show
Ooh, I'll top the bill, I'll overkill
I have to find the will to carry on
On with the show
On with the show
The show - the show must go on
Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on"
These Are The Days Of Our Lives	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/these_are_the_days_of_our_lives-lyrics-56247.html	Disc: 2	"Sometimes I get to feeling I was back in the old days, long ago
When we were kids when we were young
Things seemed so perfect, you know
The days were endless we were crazy we were young
The sun was always shining, we just lived for fun
Sometimes it seems like lately, I just don't know
The rest of my life's been just a show
Those were the days of our lives, the bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true
When I look and I find, I still love you
You can't turn back the clock you can't turn back the tide... Ain't that a shame
I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride, when life was just a game
No use in sitting and thinking on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately, I just don't know
Better sit back and go with the flow
Because these are the days of our lives
They've flown in the swiftness of time
These days are all gone now but some things remain
When I look and I find no change
Those were the days of our lives, yeah
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing's still true
When I look and I find... I still love you
I still love you"
Through The Night	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/through_the_night-lyrics-1299529.html	Queen and Paul Rodgers: The Cosmos Rocks	"Tell me something that'll ease my pain
I am living life in vain
Crying doesn't help me any more
Tell me something that'll ease my mind
I am walking the line
Trying doesn't get my anywhere
I wander through the night
All the stars are shining bright
Searching for a guiding light
I wander through the night
Tell me something 'cause I need to know
Can you teach me how to live
How to understand how to love and how to give
Anger burns in bitterness and fills me up inside
I can't face it and there's no place I can hide
I wander through the night
All the stars are shining bright
Searching for a guiding light
I wander through the night
Tell me something 'cause I need to know
Can you teach me how to live
How to understand how to love and how to give
Anger burns in bitterness and fills me up inside
Without your love there's nowhere I can hide
I wander through the night
All the stars are shining bright
Earching for a guding light
I wander through the night"
Tie Your Mother Down	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/tie_your_mother_down-lyrics-56137.html	Greatest Hits III	"Get your party gown and get your pigtail down
And get your heart beating baby
Got my timing right I got my act all tight
It's gotta be tonight, my little school babe
Your mama says you don't, and your daddy says you won't
And I'm boiling up inside, ain't no way I'm gonna lose out this time
Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Lock your daddy out of doors, I don't need him nosing around
Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight
You're such a dirty louse, go get out of my house
That's all I ever get from your...
family ties, in fact I don't think I ever heard
A single little civil word from those guys
I don't give a light, I'm gonna make out all right
I've got a sweetheart hand, to put a stop to all that
Sniping and grousing
Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Take your little brother swimming
With a brick (that's all right)
Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Or you ain't no friend of mine
Your mama and your daddy, gonna plague me till I die
I can't understand it, because I'm a peace loving guy
Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Get that big, big, big, big, big, big, daddy out the door
Tie your mother down yeah, Tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight...all your love tonight"
Time To Shine	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/time_to_shine-lyrics-1299530.html	Queen and Paul Rodgers: The Cosmos Rocks	"With the sun in your eyes and the wind in your face
To heaven you rise in a holy embrace
Your feet on the round your head in the clouds
And you're wondering if you're never coming down
In an istant the mysteries of life will unfold
The myths and the dragons of time will explode
Here's to a real understanding of truth
For compassion and grace to be given their chance too
Raise up your mind
It's time to shine
A moment down through millennium
Unveiling the secrets of song to be sung
Waters of life flowing soft to the touch
Wisdom remembered have we forgotten oh so much
Raise up your mind
It's time to shine
Raise up your mind
Hey, it's time to shine
Let's awaken from barbarity
Into a world of serenity
Beyond the rage of foolish pride
And on to the golden shores of paradise
Raise up your mind
Hey, it's time to shine
Raise up your mind
Hey, it's time to shine
Raise up your mind
Your time to shine
It's time to shine
It's time to shine:"
Too Much Love Will Kill You	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/too_much_love_will_kill_you-lyrics-56068.html	Disc: 2	"I'm just the pieces of the man I used to be
Too many bitter tears are raining down on me
I'm far away from home and I've been facing this alone for much too long
Oh, I feel like no-one ever told the truth to me
About growing up and what a struggle it would be
In my tangled state of mind, I've been looking back to find where I went wrong
Too much love will kill you, if you can't make up your mind
Torn between the lover and the love you leave behind
You're headed for disaster because you never read the signs
Too much love will kill you every time
I'm just the shadow of the man I used to be
And it seems like there's no way out of this for me
I used to bring you sunshine now all I ever do is bring you down
How would it be if you were standing in my shoes
Can't you see that it's impossible to choose
No there's no making sense of it
Every way I go I'm bound to lose, oh yeah
Too much love will kill you, just as sure as none at all
It'll drain the power that's in you, make you plead, and scream, and crawl
And the pain will make you crazy, you're the victim of your crime
Too much love will kill you every time
Yeah, too much love will kill you
It'll make your life a lie, Yes too much love will kill you
And you won't understand why, you'd give your life you'd sell your soul
But here it comes again
Too much love will kill you
In the end...
In the end"

Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

What the world is about

Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why - why - why?
Love love love love love love love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love give love give love give love
give love give love give love give love give love
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the (People on streets) edge of the night
And loves (People on streets) dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves

But oh I just wanna
Hold up my hands
And say I'm
Taking a chance on you love
Woah I'm taking a chance on you love
I'm not superstitious
And I don't wear no charm
I don't carry my heart on the sleeve of my arm
Seven years of bad luck
Please don't worry me
'Cause when I look in the mirror
Here's the future I see
I'm taking a chance on you love
Woah, I'm taking a chance on you love
Place your bets, Better yet
Don't forget, What I said
Roll the dice, Spin the wheel
Always remember, You've got to keep it real
Don't believe in voodoo
Black magic was never my style
But I believe you do
And it won't take much time
To gather the portions
That weave your magic spell
The moon on the ocean
Has a secret to tell
But anyway I'm
Taking a chance on you love
Woah I'm taking a chance on you love
Woah I'm taking a chance on you love"

Well they look so pretty as they march and drill
It's such, a pity that they're dressed to kill
Soldiers marching two by two
When it all comes down they know exactly what to do
Here come the... war
Warboys, warboys, children and their toys
Warboys, warboys, make lot a noise
Warboys, when the lightning exlpodes

Well they look so fierce they're gonna tear out your heart
When they get near we're gonna see what they got

Helping to kill, those who deserve to die
Tell me who decides

Did I achieve what I had set in my sights
Am I a happy man, or is this sinking sand
Was it all worth it, was it all worth it
Yeah, now hear my story, let me tell you about it
We bought a drum kit, I blew my own trumpet
Played the circuit, thought we were perfect
Was it all worth it, ooh giving (hey yeah) all my heart and soul and
Staying up all night, was it all worth it (hey yeah)
Living breathing rock 'n' roll (ah), a Godforsaken life
Was it all worth it, was it all worth it (hey) all these years
Put down our money without counting the cost
It didn't matter if we won - if we lost
Yes we were vicious, yes we could kill
Yes we were hungry, yes we were brill - ha ha haa
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
We served a purpose, like a bloody circus
We were so dandy (yeah) we love you madly
Was it all worth it
Living breathing rock 'n' roll, this Godforsaken life
Was it all worth it yeah, was it all worth it
When the hurly burly's done
We went to bali, saw God and dali
So mystic, surrealistic
Was it all worth it yeah yeah, giving all my heart and soul
Staying up all night, was it all worth it

We Believe	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/we_believe-lyrics-1299533.html	Queen and Paul Rodgers: The Cosmos Rocks	"I believe there's no evil out there we didn't have a hand in
You believe it's a time for peace and a time for understanding
Some of us believe that we are chosen
And if God is on our side we'll win the game
And some of us believe that there's a heaven
When the trumpets sound and the judges call your name
But let's get it straight:
I believe there's just once chance in this world to hear our brothers
You believe there's a better way to listen to each other
We don't get what the other guy is saying
We hear the words but we don't understand
So around the world the same old anger raging
And we all cry for shame and the same old tragedy goes down
We believe there's a better way to fight
There's a way to make our children safe at night
We believe there's a war we could be winning
But the only way to win it is to give what we need to receive
I believe we need a hero to step boldly from the shadows
You believe there must be someone on the scene that fits the bill
A man or a woman who knows how to say I'm sorry
With courage in his heart to match his creed
A leader who can build a brand new morning
And match the tide of changes
Match the intent with the deed
We believe there's a deed of obligation
To bring reconciliation
To make peace with every nation - in our time
We believe there's not a minute we should be wasting
When the darkness falls it's too late to fix the crime
It's peace that we need
Every father every mother knows the meaning
Human treasure that our leaders do forget
And the bullets fly in the face of common reason
And the pain we give is the legacy in the end we get
We believe there's a song that's worth the singing
It's a song of truth we're bringing
There's a way to share the Earth with everyone
We believe every creature has a being
Has a right to respect and feeling
To live and breathe and flourish in the sun
That's what we believe"

So sad her eyes, as it began
On such a breathless night as this, upon my brow the lightest kiss
I walked alone...
And all around the air did sway, my lady soon will stir this way
In sorrow known, the white queen walks
And the night grows pale, stars of lovingness in her hair
Heeding, unheard, pleading one word
So sad, my eyes, she cannot see
How did thee fare what have thee seen
The mother of the willow green, I call her name
And 'neath her window have I stayed, I loved the footsteps that she made
And when she came, white queen how my heart did ache
And dry my lips no word would make, so still I wait
My goddess hear my darkest fear, I speak too late
It's for evermore that I wait

So sad, it ends as it began"

Never contemplating my point of view
This comes as no surprise
I'm a fool for I believed your lies
But now I've seen through your disguise
Who needs, well I don't need, who needs you?
Oh I believed you, went on my knees to you
How I trusted you, but you turned me down
But it's dog eat dog in this rat race
And it leaves you bleeding lying flat on your face
Reaching out, reaching out for a helping hand
Where is that helping hand?
(Oh muchachos.... I like it, I like it)
Well I don't need you, how I was pushed around
Don't let it get you down, you walked all over me
But don't you ever give in
Taking one step forward, slipping two steps back
There's an empty feeling that you can't forget
Reaching out, for a helping hand
When I met you you were always charming
Couldn't sleep at night 'till you were mine
You were oh so, so sophisticated
Never interested in what I'd say
I had to swallow my pride
So naive, you took me for a ride
But now I'm the one to decide
Who needs, well I don't need, who needs you?"

Every time you make a move you destroy my mind
And the way you touch, I lose control and shiver deep inside
You take my breath away
You can reduce me to tears with a single sigh
Every breath that you take
Any sound that you make, is a whisper in my ear
I could give up all my life for just one kiss
I would surely die if you dismiss me from your love
You take my breath away
So please don't go, don't leave me here all by myself
I get ever so lonely from time to time
I will find you anywhere you go, I'll be right behind you
Right until the ends of the earth
I'll get no sleep until I find you
To tell you that you just take my breath away
I will find you anywhere you go
Right until the ends of the earth
I'll get no sleep until I find you
To tell you when I've found you
...I love you"
You're My Best Friend	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/youre_my_best_friend-lyrics-56160.html	Greatest Hits	"Ooh, you make me live
Whatever this world can give to me
It's you, you're all I see
Ooh, you make me live now honey
Ooh, you make me live
Oh, you're the best friend
That I ever had
I've been with you such a long time
You're my sunshine
And I want you to know
That my feelings are true
I really love you
(Ooh) Oh, you're my best friend
Ooh, you make me live
Ooh, I've been wandering round
But I still come back to you (still come back to you)
In rain or shine
You've stood by me girl
I'm happy at home (happy at home)
You're my best friend
Ooh, you make me live
Whenever this world is cruel to me
I got you, to help me forgive - oo oo ooh
Ooh, you make me live now honey
Ooh, you make me live
Oh, you're the first one
When things turn out bad
You know I'll never be lonely
You're my only one
And I love the thing
I really love the things that you do
Oh, you're my best friend
Oh, ooh, you make me live
I'm happy (happy at home)
You're my best friend
Oh, oh, you're my best friend
Ooh, you make me live
Oo oo ooh
You, you're my best friend"
You're So Square (Baby I Don't Care)	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/queen/youre_so_square_baby_i_dont_care-lyrics-56237.html	Live At Wembley '86	"You're So Square (Baby I Don't Care)
Written by Leiber, Stoller
Okay, we're gonna fool around a bit, come on
You don't like crazy things
You don't like rockin' baby
You just wanna go to the movie show
Sit there holdin' hands
You're so square (baby I don't care)
Do wop, do wop
Do wop, do wop
I don't ???? (do wop)
I don't ???? (do wop)
I only wanna love you baby
I guess it's just because
You're so square (baby I don't care)
Do wop, do wop
Do wop, do wop
I don't need ??? dances
But I do
????
???
I do I do I do
I don't like crazy things (do wop)
I don't like rockin' baby (do wop)
I just wanna go to a movie show
Sit there holdin' hands
You're so square
Baby I don't care (do wop, do wop)
Baby I don't care (do wop, do wop)
Baby I don't care (do wop, do wop)
Hey"
